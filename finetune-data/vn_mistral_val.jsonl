I would also like to especially thank the Honorable Vice Minister, Ms Nguyen Thi Nghia for her inspiring opening speech.\n\nDistinguished guests,\n\nA national workshop was organized in September 2018 by Viet Nam Institute of Education Science, with technical support from UNFPA to disseminate key findings of the Review of the situation of the sexuality and reproductive health education programmes in the secondary schools in Viet Nam. The review report provided long term recommendation to MOET to meet the international standards for age-appropriate CSE by grade, starting in Grade 1, that are set out in details in the International Technical Guidance on Comprehensive Sexuality Education jointly developed by UNESCO, UNFPA, UNAIDS, UNICEF, WHO.\n\nAt this meeting, Vice Minister Nghia agreed to have further orientation workshop to develop technical guidance on CSE for secondary teachers in Viet Nam, and today we meet here to discuss further on this important issue.\n\nLadies and gentlemen,\n\nCSE is the crossroads at which education and health meet. It is vital to advancing health outcomes and gender equality. It gives young people the knowledge and refection they need to build supportive and respectful ultimate relationships and avoid damaging ones. It helps them navigate life-changing decisions about their sexual and reproductive health, and have healthy and secure lives.\n\nInternational experiences showed that CSE can be delivered as a stand-alone subject, incorporated into a subject like health education or personal development, or fully incorporated as separate modules within relevant subjects. It should also be included in pre-service and in-service teacher training and in the system for inspections and monitoring and evaluation.\n\nBy investing in their health and education, Viet Nam can support young people's engagement in society, ensure their well-being, and help them achieve their full potential.\n\nDistinguished guests,\n\nSome of the 13.5 million adolescents in Viet Nam today will be well-prepared, continuing their education and acquiring the information and skills they need to negotiate safe and pleasurable sexual relationships; choose their partners, who fit their needs; decide if and when to start a family; have options for decent employment; and play important roles in the community.\n\nBut too many adolescents, particularly girls, are woefully unprepared for this new and challenging phase in their lives. They leave school early, receive no sexuality education, enter marriages when they are still children, have children when they are still themselves children. Many others do finish school, but have their ideas of relationships and sexuality on unrealistic role models on social media. And there are too many adolescent boys who will not have enough information about how to take care their bodies, and of whom some will not have been educated to respect women, and will develop abuse behaviors.\n\nLadies and gentlemen,\n\nThe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development has not only committed to leaving no one behind, it has challenged all of us to strive to reach the furthest behind first. We know who these adolescents are but we are far from achieving this.\n\nTo meet the urgent need of students on CSE, MOET should improve the quality of the content on SRH and life skills in the newly developed curriculum and its delivery. Furthermore, to ensure CSE well integrated in the curriculum and effectively delivered to students, positive attitude of teachers as well as the technical guidance on CSE for them to use will be essential.\n\nIn 2019 work-plan, UNFPA and UNESCO will provide join support to MOET in developing a technical guidance on CSE in line with the International Technical Guidance on Comprehensive Sexuality Education.\n\nWe strongly recommend that the technical guidance should be officially issued by MOET and used widely to all Departments of Education, and schools to ensure the sustainable integration of CSE in the new secondary curriculum.\n\nFor long-term strategy, MOET needs to form an advocacy coalition with interested stakeholders, such as UN agencies, NGOs and develop a strategic advocacy plan for the inclusion of a stand-alone subject that includes CSE.\n\nDistinguished guests,\n\nWe count on your leadership to champion the cause of CSE, and I hope that by the end of this meeting, we will agree on a roadmap for the way forward. One that will help guide how we work together, where we can strengthen and support each other, and how we can be strategic in our engagements.\n\nIn this, the United Nations, including UNFPA and UNESCO in Viet Nam has been and will continue to be your foremost supporter and partner.\n\nThank you."}]}

Industrialization has been and remains one of the key driving forces for these achievements. Viet Nam is, however, facing major challenges in ensuring high quality and sustainable growth and development, including increasing vulnerability to climate change and environmental degradation, low productivity growth based on labour intensive employment and low resource efficiency. It needs to step up both innovation and private sector engagement to unlock Viet Nam's potential as well as to attract investment in large scale projects in renewable energy and energy efficiency.\n\nViet Nam has also achieved impressive developments in terms of poverty reduction. Nevertheless, important bottlenecks remain for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Viet Nam is lagging behind on the SDGs related to Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure (SDG 9), Climate Change and Environmental Sustainability (SDGs 13, 14, 15), and Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions (SDG 16). Substantial financial resources are required for Agenda 2030 implementation at a time when grant ODA is declining.\n\nAgainst this background, the project on Eco-industrial park (EIP) development came at the very right time to help the Government and businesses to address some of these key challenges. Over the past four years of implementation, the project has helped to:\n\nColleagues and friends,\n\nThis project fits very well within the UN's One Strategic Plan 2017-2021, especially in prioritising two out of the four main areas of the UN's work in Viet Nam: climate resilience and environmental sustainability and fostering prosperity and partnership for an inclusive and sustainable economic growth model.\n\nThis project also provides a vivid illustration of what some aspects of a circular economy will entail, about which the Government of Viet Nam is keen to learn from the experience of the UN and other development partners in order to identify strategic priorities for its socio-economic development over the 2021-2030 period. For this medium-term vision, the Government is placing high ambition on achieving \"dual targets\": sustaining a high growth rate and protecting the environment. Eco-industrial parks should be one of the key priorities given that there are 325 industrial parks in Viet Nam which contribute significantly to national industrial outputs and employment.\n\nThe UN Secretary General, H.E. Antonio Guterres will convene a high-level Climate Action Summit in New York in September 2019 to boost ambition and accelerate actions to implement the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. In supporting this process, the UN Country Team in Viet Nam is currently conducting a bottleneck analysis to identify challenges and opportunities to enhance the implementation of Viet Nam's Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC). The analysis focuses on six transformative areas which will be covered by the Summit, including energy transition, industry transition and climate finance.\n\nThe Eco-industrial park initiative has been highlighted by stakeholders as one of the key potential accelerators to boost the ambition and commitments by the Government of Viet Nam. However, for this to materialize or happen, more conducive inter-ministerial coordination between MONRE, MOIT and MOST on development of technical guidelines for Eco-industrial parks conducive to a circular economy are needed to address the pending policy level and implementation bottlenecks which include but are not limited to the application of a sizeable renewable energy system within the parks or the reuse of recycled water among companies, and other industrial and industrial-urban symbiosis solutions.\n\nI am pleased to note that even though this is the closing workshop, it is not the end of this very innovative initiative since there will be a continuing project through the Viet Nam component of UNIDO's global Eco-industrial parks programme funded by the Government of Switzerland whom I would like to thank. I hope that institutional coordination will be improved, and regulatory barriers will be removed to enable further achievements of this initiative including its scaling up at a national level.\n\nI wish you all good health, happiness, and success!\n\nThank you! Xin cảm ơn!"}]}

At the outset, allow me to welcome students from various schools in Hanoi who are joining the dialogue with the Under-Secretary-General on one of the most challenging and pressing issues of our times and the 21st century – Climate Change.\n\nClimate change has already had a huge impact on both our environment and humankind. It requires more attention and discussion in general as well as solid and concrete action by both individuals, States and especially the private sector to change the fate of the planet and its inhabitants. It is not surprising that the UN75 Report launched at the 75th Session of the UN General Assembly in September 2020 revealed that there were “overwhelming concerns on the climate crisis and the destruction of our natural environment” among the people around the world. I believe today’s discussion will be an important one concluding the 75th anniversary of the UN’s commemoration in Viet Nam and proposing clearer directions for the UN’s next years ahead both globally and in Viet Nam.\n\nStudents, youth representatives and teachers,\n\nI am now delighted to introduce you to UN Under-Secretary-General, Mr. Fabrizio Hochschild, the Special Adviser to the UN Secretary-General on the Commemoration of the United Nation’s 75th Anniversary. In that role, he led the UN75 activities and discussions around the world under the theme “Shaping Our Future” through a system-wide process of consultations and reflections on the role of the United Nations in advancing international co-operation and in supporting the ability of Member States to respond to emerging challenges and frontier issues. Mr. Hochschild began his United Nations career with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in 1988 and has served in various field and HQ settings. Among the many important positions he has held, Mr. Hochschild most recently, before his current position, served as Assistant Secretary-General for Strategic Coordination in the Executive Office of the UN Secretary-General (2017-2019), and before that as UN Resident Coordinator, Humanitarian Coordinator and Resident Representative of the UN Development Programme (UNDP) in Colombia from 2013 to 2016 which is when we first met. I would also like to thank Fabrizio for joining us today at a very early morning hour during NYs cold and dark winter months to accommodate our schedule. I remember them from over 10 years living there and I am glad I am not there!\n\nI look forward to listening to your ideas and thoughts, and to how you view the role of young people in Viet Nam on climate action now and in the future. Later, we will also discuss the role the UN can play to support youth in climate action for a better, stronger and sustainable world through an interactive Q&A session with Under-Secretary-General Hothschild.\n\nI look forward to a stimulating evening. Thank you for your attention. Xin Cam On."}]}

However, gender inequality remains an issue which is limiting the country’s potential for further development.\n\nFor instance, there are still gaps in gender equality such as glass ceilings to reach top positions, gender stereotypes, and limited opportunities for women in various sectors.\n\nWomen continue to be underrepresented in the STEM fields (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics). Gender-based violence also remains a major challenge that needs to be addressed urgently.\n\nDigitalization presents a unique opportunity to close the gender gap and promote economic growth. It has the potential to create new industries, new jobs, and increase efficiency in existing ones.\n\nIt is also an essential tool for promoting women's economic empowerment, agency and entrepreneurship, especially in poor and rural areas. This week, as VGCL reports that 100.000 of workers get there working hours cut or are being laid off, digitalization is part of the solution.\n\nWomen makes up roughly half the population, and as Vietnam embarks on its national digital transformation strategy till 2025 - with an orientation towards 2030, it is essential to ensure that women are equally represented and have the same opportunity to gain new skills, become innovators, leaders, and champions in digitalization.\n\nAccording to the World Economic Forum, gender equality is positively correlated with a nation's competitiveness, and countries with higher levels of gender equality tend to have more developed digital economies.\n\nBy promoting gender equality in the tech sector, Vietnam could attract more foreign investment, move up the value chain and increase its competitiveness in the global marketplace.\n\nTo address these challenges, we need to work together in partnership. International partners including the EU and Sweden can contribute by supporting initiatives that promote gender equality, including in the field of digitalisation.\n\nSweden currently holds the Presidency of the EU in the spring of 2023. The Sweden’s EU Presidency recognizes that gender equality is crucial for achieving the UN sustainable development goals in building an inclusive society.\n\nThe EU Gender Action Plan III, for 2021 to 2025, is a good example of our joint commitment in this endeavor. Among other goals, this plan is designed to promote gender-responsive digitalization and ensure that women and girls have equal access to and can fully participate in the digital economy.\n\nIn order to engage Vietnamese youth, the EU has also launched a project in Hanoi, Da Nang, and Ho Chi Minh City that aims to address gender stereotypes and promote gender equality. This project provides a platform for young people to share their experiences and perspectives on gender issues and to develop innovative solutions to address them.\n\nBecause the gender divide in tech starts with the gender stereotyping of boys and girls – girls get dolls to play with, boys get tech -toys. Boys are more encouraged to focus their studies on STEM. And boys spend considerably more time gaming than girls, making them more familiar with the latest technologies. There are fewer female role models in tech- business and its harder for female tech- entrepreneurs to access capital for scaling up their business.\n\nThat’s why we also have to work with the business sector to promote gender equality. The Embassy of Sweden is engaging with our Swedish companies like Ericsson, IKEA, TetraPak, ABB and H&M to mention a few, which have already shown strong commitment to promoting gender equality and women's empowerment in their operations and supply chains.\n\nGiven the above and for the sake of the dialogue today, I would like to offer some key thoughts as we discuss how to promote women's advancement via digitalization:\n\n-One good strategy for Vietnam to achieve gender equality is to invest in education and skills training for girls and women. By promoting and providing equal access to education, especially in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), women and girls can develop the skills necessary to adapt and succeed in the digital era.\n\n-Another critical aspect is to create an enabling environment for women in the workplace. This includes implementing policies that promote work-life balance, providing equal pay for equal work, and addressing discrimination and harassment in the workplace.\n\n-Let me end by emphasizing that promoting gender equality is a shared responsibility. It requires a concerted effort from governments, the private sector and the civil society. We look forward to continuing our partnership with all three to promote gender equality through digitalization in Vietnam.\n\nXin cam on rat nhieu!"}]}

Let me start by thanking the Hanoi University of Science and Technology for allowing us to host this event here, the Youth Union of the university for their organizational support and the global UN Free and Equal Campaign for their generous support. I want to thank also all our LGBTI+ partners and friends for contributing to making this an exciting and informative celebration.\n\nWe have called this event “Diversity Day” because today we celebrate the colorful mosaic that is human life in all its forms, shapes and sizes.\n\nToday we celebrate unity in diversity.\n\nWe emphasize our individual uniqueness, how we stand out, in one way or another. Whether because of our complexion, whom we love, our opinions, gender, ability, how we look. You name it. We are, in that sense, all different.\n\nToday, however, we are celebrating that our differences do not mean that we are separate or disconnected from each other. Far from it.\n\nOn the contrary, we are united in our diversity. In the words of the groundbreaking Universal Declaration of Human Rights; “All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights”. This powerful principle expresses that regardless of whatever differences may divide us, we are all united as free and equal human beings.\n\nEach year, on Human Rights Day on December 10, we celebrate the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948. This year the theme isyouth standing up for human rights. Moreover, in late-November and early December, globally as well as here in Viet Nam, we engage in 16 Days of Activism against Gender-Based Violence. And just two days ago, the world celebrated the International Volunteer Day focused on volunteering for an inclusive future.\n\nWhile different, these campaigns all highlight the crucial importance of ensuring inclusion and non-discrimination. They all embody the principle of our essential equality in dignity and rights.\n\nToday we are celebrating and highlighting one source of this diversity, namely our different sexual orientations, gender identities and gender expressions. Today we want to celebrate those who stand out because of whom they love, how they identify or how they express their gender identity.\n\nThis is an area where Viet Nam has made important progress in recent years. For one, it is no longer prohibited for two persons of the same sex to get married. Moreover, significant strides have been made to develop a law to provide access to gender affirmation. We hope that this work will soon materialize into a law allowing transgender persons to legally change their gender marker without requiring medical intervention.\n\nBut despite this progress, it is also an area where more work is needed. People continue to face stigma and discrimination because of their sexual orientation, gender identity or expression. This affects their access to many important social services including, significantly, education. Although more data is still needed, research shows, for example, that in schools LGBT students in Viet Nam face higher levels of gender-based violence than their peers and that education institutions are not safe for them.\n\nTo reduce stigma and discrimination here, as elsewhere, youth play a crucial role. Non-discrimination and inclusiveness start with you, the university students, the youth. You need to stand up against discrimination, stigma and gender-based violence. You also need to volunteer to support inclusiveness and to end prejudice.\n\nToday we celebrate that despite our differences, we are all free and equal – we are all the same in ways such as freedom and equality which really matter. We celebrate what is eloquently expressed in the Vietnamese proverb – and I apologize for the English translation – that “despite being different species, winter melons and gourds are grown on the same structure and in the same place, so they should love each other”.\n\nAllow me to conclude on this positive note by wishing everyone a happy Diversity Day. I hope that you will all have fun here today and enjoy all the many activities that you can join or just cheer on. And more importantly, I hope that your interactions and the information you will receive today will help make you all ambassadors of inclusiveness!\n\nThank you! Xin cảm ơn!"}]}

We have come together today to celebrate how people and communities in Viet Nam have reduced their exposure to disasters and to share recent experiences of responses, prevention and control of the risks they face. This year, there is a special focus on one of the seven targets of the Sendai Framework - Target C, reducing disaster economic losses in relation to global GDP by 2030.\n\nAccording to the Global Climate Risk Index 2018, Viet Nam ranks among the top 10 countries affected by the impacts of weather-related loss events. Since the 1970's disasters have caused more than 500 deaths annually in Viet Nam, and cost more than 1.5% of GDP in economic losses. Viet Nam's climate change nationally determined contribution highlights that these costs could well rise to 3-5% of GDP by 2030. Ensuring coastal resilience to climate induced natural disasters is not rhetoric, but a strong mandate to households, businesses, and authorities at all levels. As you are aware, the coastal areas of Vietnam are the breadbasket of the nation. Without a well-designed resilience framework, large-scale disasters will exacerbate economic losses.\n\nThe extensive El-Nino induced drought and salt water intrusion in 2015-2016, Typhoon Damrey in 2017 and flooding in 2018 highlight the devastating impacts of both slow and sudden-onset disasters in Viet Nam, with the most vulnerable groups such as the poor, children, women, and ethnic minorities among the most severely affected. Although Vietnam has made advanced improvements in humanitarian responses and relief, much is needed to fully understand the economic losses that arise from large-scale disasters.\n\nWith over USD 8 million from the UN's Central Emergency Response Fund from 2016 to 2018, the UN in Viet Nam had the unprecedented opportunity to support the Government, the Viet Nam Red Cross Society and NGO's to assist more than half a million people addressing the most urgent and live-saving needs for water and sanitation, health, nutrition, food security, and shelter. The UN and humanitarian partners are working with Viet Nam to implement lessons learned and improve the delivery of assistance by reinforcing the coordination frameworks for Disaster Response Management, such as implementing rapid, detailed Post-Disaster Needs Assessment, to enable a full disaster recovery framework. But we also recognize that speeding up the delivery and efficiency of assistance to the more vulnerable beneficiaries is a just one element of a very complex effort. We are witnessing a shift in disaster reduction strategy from an emergency response approach to an effective balance between disaster response and risk reduction through resilience building. This sound approach is at the core of the Sendai Framework 2030 of which Viet Nam is a committed member.\n\nAs we stand here today in the heart of the Mekong Delta, we are fortunate to have flood levels below level 2. If they should exceed level 3, many parts of this lush green beautiful delta will be submerged, affecting millions of people and causing tremendous economic losses to the people and to the national budget.\n\nMeeting the challenges posed by the economic impacts of climate change and natural disasters requires risk-informed planning across sectors, levels of government, and organizations. It is important that individuals, ministries, and agencies from both public and private sectors take concrete actions to understand risks, address vulnerabilities and make development plans that take these risks into account. In the planning process, actions must be well funded and integrated into the development process of each sector, each province and finally of the nation. With long-term, risk-informed development planning, Viet Nam can put a brake on the ever-mounting economic impact of climate and disaster-related damages and losses.\n\nRecognizing communication on disaster risks and response is another critical element in reducing potential losses, including economic losses and the UN has supported MARD through projects, such as the community-based DRR model, to empower people with the information they need to help protect themselves from natural disasters and climate change effects. Working in partnership, government can create an enabling environment for disaster risk reduction - empowering farmers and workers to better understand how disasters will impact them, ensuring that people have access to accurate and clear information, and promoting effective risk management approaches that can leverage public investment, but also private sector tools such as insurance.\n\nLadies and Gentlemen;\n\nWith predictions of more frequent and intense hazard events, I welcome the efforts of all key relevant partners who have gathered here today to learn from the past and to forge a stronger partnership for the future. To this end, the UN Disaster Risk Reduction for Resilience Joint Result Group has been working to support MARD's initiative of forming a partnership on DRR between the Government and development partners including the private sector. We stand behind this initiative to facilitate coordination on DRR for resilience, and to improve coherence of partners' support for DRR across different sectors and agencies, which is at the core of the Sendai Framework Targets and DRR-related SDGs.\n\nFollowing the very effective contribution of Viet Nam to the Asian Ministerial Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction in Mongolia, we are working with a clear picture on the situation of Viet Nam in the seven areas of the Sendai targets. Guided by the Action Plan 2018-2020 of the Asian Ministerial Conference, Viet Nam and the UN have identified five areas of national priorities:\n\nThe challenge ahead is formidable. And there is no time to lose. I am encouraged to have your presence today, particularly the contributions of the key ministries who are working on related matters from MARD, VDMA, CCNDPC as well as the Private Sector. I am proud to say that the UN in Viet Nam is a committed partner to support Viet Nam to put in place leading edge disaster risk planning. I wish today's session every success and look forward to a lively and informative discussion.\n\nXin Cảm Ơn!"}]}

One in ten women continue to experience sexual violence by an abuser other than their husband since the age of 15.\n\nGender-based violence affects women and their families considerably. According to the national study, victims of violence have higher risks of miscarriage, stillbirths, and abortion, and their children’s wellbeing and daily lives are also labored. Victims experience direct physical injuries, and there are also impacts on other parts of their lives such as mental health and income earning potentials. The national study estimated that women who experienced violence from husbands or partners were 3 times more likely to self-report many symptoms of mental distress (7%), compared with women who had not experienced any violence (2%). We must underline that gender-based violence also has a negative impact on the country’s economy as well. The national study showed that gender-based violence costed Viet Nam 1.81% of GDP in 2018.\n\nIn an effort to eliminate violence against women and girls, we as UNFPA think it essential that we join hands with men and boys, and it is our strategic choice to promote the work of men and boys who are committed to ending gender-based violence. In this context, UNFPA partnered with CSAGA to organize the contest “Men Take Action – Stop Violence against Women,” for men and boys playing a crucial role in challenging socio-cultural context of Viet Nam when it comes to gender-based violence, questioning the effectiveness of masculinity, and taking a personal responsibility to change socio-cultural norms. Men and boys are capable of preventing violence against women by not personally engaging in violence, intervening against the violence committed by other men, and addressing the root cause of gender-based violence.\n\nDear participants to the contest,\n\nI am delighted to learn that the contest has received more than 100 entries. There are videos, posters, photo stories, and infographics. All of them carry strong messages about what gender-based violence is, and why it must be stopped. Many also deliver the right message that we will not be able to stop violence against women and girls successfully without the involvement of men and boys. So, while we are giving the awards of the contest today, I would like to say that everyone who joined this contest is the winners. I was personally so impressed with such strong communication and advocacy skills of young people in the campaign to achieve “Zero gender-based violence and harmful practices to women and girls”. The 2019 National Study shows the positive change in young people toward gender equality and violence against women. UNFPA looks forward to keeping this momentum created, and in Vietnam’s development process, we are not leaving women and girls behind due to gender-based violence.\n\nDear local media representatives,\n\nI would like to take this opportunity to call on Vietnamese reporters and editors to join me and UNFPA Vietnam to raise public awareness thatWe must take an action now to end violence against women and girls. Men and boys should be central part of the solution!\n\nI must highlight the important role that the media play in changing Vietnam’s socio-cultural practice of silence when it comes to gender-based violence. Violence against women is still hidden in society, as almost half of women never told any anyone about violence, and 90.4% did not seek help from formal services or authorities, according to the 2019 national study.\n\nWe need to break the silence, so that survivors of gender-based violence can speak up, and seek help and services. The media needs to explain that violence against women has serious consequences on the social and economic growth of the country. No matter where violence happens, in what forms, or who it affects, it must be stopped.\n\nAnd without actions from men and boys, we cannot create a world where both men and women, and boys and girls, can enjoy a life free from violence. Men and boys are an important part of the solution to end gender-based violence.\n\nThank you very much for your attention."}]}

I would like to congratulate the Government for swiftly laying down the Action Plan, which is the single most important step in the first year the SDGs came into force.\n\nToday's meeting is a breakthrough for two reasons:\n\n- it is the first sectoral-focused SDG discussion following the drafting of the National SDG Action plan; and\n\n- it re-affirms people's centrality in the SDGs and health at the core of human development.\n\nAs we move forward, it is important to reflect on the true meaning of the SDGs and I would like to offer some thoughts on this.\n\n1) The SDGs provide us with the opportunity to strengthen our focus towards equity for all.\n\nLeaving no one behind is the ultimate goal of the SDGs. This is a strong reminder for us to ensure that all efforts are made to address the inequities that contribute to poor health and stall the attainment of the highest potential for human development.\n\nInequities in health need broader actions along the social determinants and the root causes of poor health. For example, significant inequities and disparities persist across geographic regions and between Kinh and ethnic minority populations. Maternal mortality rates are twice as high in rural areas, and three times higher among ethnic minority groups than Kinh. The trend is similar for under-five mortality rate with high rates among ethnic minorities and in rural mountainous and disadvantaged areas.\n\nAs we move forward in developing and implementing our operational plans for health, let us ensure that we put the most vulnerable including ethnic minorities, migrants, children, adolescents, LGBT, people living with HIV, people with disabilities at the centre and ensure that every measure or indicator we define will help to reflect how they have been reached or how their lives have been impacted by our interventions.\n\n2) Health as a development agenda.\n\nThe SDGs also provide us a platform to position health as a development agenda. Vibrant and well-developed economies depend on a healthy and productive population. The history of well-developed economies shows us that development policies were undertaken alongside strong health reforms that focused on the provision of essential health services at the primary care level as well as efficient health financing policies that support universal health coverage. This is essential in the context of a lower middle-income Viet Nam given declining international support.\n\n3) It will take the whole nation to achieve SDGs and therefore multi-sectoral action isn't optional, it's imperative.\n\nSDGs are not just indicators to be measured - they are global, regional and national and multi-sectoral efforts to comprehensively respond to the diverse needs of dynamic populations.\n\nThe interconnectedness of the SDGs serves as a framework to develop societies and communities that will support the attainment of health and well-being. Approximately 75% of health outcomes are dependent on living and working conditions of the population. The right policies on the environment and climate change, food safety, animal health, transportation and air quality, social protection and economic productivity among others will all contribute to good health.\n\nThe health sector will need to forge partnerships with other sectors and strengthened policy dialogue between government and its partners (including CSOs and the private sector) will be crucial to ensure we attain the health goals and that health is a positive contributor to achievement of the others.\n\n4) Mutual accountability in the attainment of SDGs is essential.\n\nThe SDGs require governments and all of partners to work together towards their attainment. It is, therefore, important for each of us to carefully consider how our individual agencies' agenda can support the attainment of SDGs in Viet Nam.\n\nMoving forward, we – the government's partners – will all need to reflect on how our development cooperation can contribute to the attainment of Viet Nam's SDGs in the context of its needs and stage of development. This will require careful planning and sustained dialogue among us. We also need to demonstrate our commitment to a shared vision for this country in line with Viet Nam's SDG agenda, and the principles of effective development cooperation embodied by the Viet Nam Health Partnership Document.\n\nWe must work towards supporting the SDG National Action Plan and the development of specific strategies to operationalize the Action Plan for sustainable improvements in the health of the population.\n\nThe UN in Viet Nam stands alongside the other development partners to support a nationwide approach to attain Viet Nam's SDGs. The UN in Viet Nam houses a wide range of technical and strategic expertise relevant to the different SDGs and we commit to making this expertise available to the health and other sectors.\n\nIn closing, I would like to thank the Ministry of Health, especially Minister Tien, for the opportunity to co-chair today's meeting on behalf of development partners including UN agencies.\n\nI look forward to a productive meeting today.\n\nThank you!\n\nXin cam on!"}]}

This important decision by the Ministry of Health has opened the door both for country-wide participation as well as the exciting prospect of the program's replication, scaling-up and potential long-term sustainability, with students and medical staff in other provinces directly and indirectly benefiting from the training and online training courses being shared by other national medical universities in Viet Nam.\n\nAs UN Resident Coordinator in Viet Nam, I find it important to also situate the remarkable results of this IBSA-project within the broader context of South-South Cooperation, which I am prioritizing for our broader UN engagement and support in Viet Nam. The IBSA-project is a clear example of such South-South Cooperation where Viet Nam has benefited from support and learning from good practice development experiences of other countries in the global south. There are many areas such as poverty reduction, education and even some aspects of health in which other countries can learn from Vietnam's experiences through South – South Cooperation and the UN in Viet Nam is prioritizing those equally.\n\nAs the Indian Ambassador has just said, the visit that I made to Hai Phong in 2017 when I had only recently arrived together with the Indian Ambassador and previous Brazilian and South African Ambassadors was clearly a turning point since we realized that the project was way behind schedule.\n\nI am pleased to recognize the strong and committed support of India, Brazil and South Africa as IBSA partners together with other UN agencies such as the United Nations Office of South – South Cooperation located in UNDP and WHO as well as our Vietnamese partners in the Ministry of Health and Hai Phong Medical University who have since 2017 been receptive to feedback and worked very hard to turn this project around. You have all joined together to make this project successful and created one of the best current showcases of South-South Cooperation in Viet Nam.\n\nOn the UN side, special thanks are due to Dr. Kidong Park, WHO Representative, who from the time of his arrival soon after which I spoke to him about this project, has given this project the attention it deserves. He brought in Ms. Bindu Varghese as the full-time project consultant and that was important because you cannot do this part-time. She has reached out for advice repeatedly and been very instrumental in helping turn around this project and make it the success that it is today.\n\nAs you know, our main mission in Viet Nam is to support the country in the implementation of Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development. To achieve this, we have prioritized more and more joint inter-agency collaboration and partnerships with the government, civil society, the private sector and international development partners in Viet Nam. The UN convenes platforms for policy debates, policy formulation and advocacy, as well as shares best global development practices and technical expertise with both national partners and local communities.\n\nOur joint UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) work and support to Viet Nam is guided by the One Strategic Plan for 2017 – 2021, jointly agreed with the Government of Viet Nam. A key area focuses on investment in people to ensure more inclusive and equitable quality social services and social protection for people, especially the most vulnerable. In this context, achieving universal health coverage and improving healthcare services, especially primary health care services, to make them equitably accessible and affordable to all Vietnamese is a high priority goal for the UN in Viet Nam.\n\nI join you and our partners in looking forward to witnessing and supporting the IBSA-project's further success through its sustainability, impact and visibility beyond its project completion in June 2019, and not least through the continued efforts of the trained health workforce in the Northern Coastal Region of Hai Phong. Allow me to build on what the South African Ambassador has very nicely put just now. The project is like an adolescent child going out in the world and while it will need to learn to be independent, it will also continue to need its parents, WHO and the Ministry of Health to continue to give it sustained support. It will not likely survive in the wild on its own, so I hope this technical support will continue from both. In this context, I am very pleased that this innovative health e-Learning project will be linked to other national programs to contribute to improving coverage and the quality of health services in Viet Nam.\n\nI take this opportunity to wish you all good health and happiness as well as success in the next stage of this initiative, and I look forward to our continuing partnership towards the achievement of Agenda 2030 and the sustainable development goals here in Viet Nam.\n\nThank You! Xin Cam On!"}]}

With prevention and effective treatment, between 2000 and 2016, we estimate that nearly half a million new HIV infections and nearly 150,000 AIDS-related deaths were averted in Viet Nam.\n\nAnd progress continues - every day - with more people testing for HIV and, if HIV positive, accessing effective HIV treatment.  Lives are saved, people stay healthy and productive and in addition, contribute to stopping the virus from spreading further. 2017 was another year of real and impressive achievements: as mentioned, the 9th year of consistent decline in new HIV infections and AIDS related deaths, which Viet Nam can be proud of.\n\nFast Tracking the HIV response for ending AIDS by 2030 is a very ambitious goal. Solid progress is not yet full success and the stakes and risks remain high. Past experience is an inspiration of what is possible but the last part of the journey towards ending AIDS may be the most complex with new challenges ahead.\n\nLadies and gentlemen, colleagues and friends,\n\nMore than ever, we have strong national political commitment and direction from Viet Nam’s leaders on ending AIDS and reaching the 90-90-90, with sufficient investment. This was reaffirmed this year with a landmark Resolution on Healthcare adopted by the Communist Party’s Central Committee and clear commitments under the new National Targeted Program for Health & Population. And many provinces, including Hai Duong, are also demonstrating strong commitment.\n\nWe know where to focus and what works best in terms of comprehensive services including innovative approaches: outreach and prevention including condoms and lubricant, pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), harm reduction including methadone treatment (MMT) and needle & syringes, testing, immediate HIV treatment, viral load, care and support in a zero stigmatization and zero discrimination environment.\n\nWe also know that sufficiently investing now in the right interventions at the right locations for the right populations will keep Viet Nam on the right track, maintaining the gains and moving faster on its journey towards the 90-90-90 and ending AIDS. For this, let us all, as a shared responsibility, mobilize greater investments and optimize all the available domestic and international human and financial resources at all levels for more efficiency and impact.\n\nOn World AIDS Day, we also commemorate all the people we lost to AIDS. The best way we can pay tribute to them is to reaffirm that, in our hearts and minds, compassion, solidarity, respect, the right to health and dignity for everyone to know about HIV, get tested and safely access quality HIV treatment with zero stigmatization and zero discrimination will remain at the center of all efforts - leaving no Vietnamese behind.\n\nThe stakes are high but so are the opportunities. Viet Nam’s journey towards ending AIDS continues with determination. Be part of it and of the solutions to stop the virus.\n\nAs Deputy Prime Minister Vu Duc Dam has urged us all today and at other occasions, “Let us join hands to achieve the 90-90-90 targets, with 100-100-100% commitment and even more”, to end AIDS by 2030.\n\nXin cam on va chuc suc khoe!"}]}

Madame Nguyen Thi Kim Ngan, Chair of the National Assembly of Viet Nam,\n\nH.E. Madame Tong Thi Phong, Vice Chair of the National Assembly,\n\nH.E. Deputy Prime Minister Vu Duc Dam,\n\nH.E. Mr. Martin Chungong, Secretary General of the IPU,\n\nDistinguished Members of the National Assembly,\n\nLadies and Gentlemen,\n\nIt is my great honour to welcome all of you to this event jointly hosted by the National Assembly of Viet Nam, the Inter-Parliamentary Union, and the United Nations in Viet Nam to discuss and exchange views about the Sustainable Development Goals known as the SDGs and the potential role of members of the National Assembly to promote their implementation.\n\nBefore I go any further, let me congratulate all Vietnamese citizens for the great win in the South East Asian football championship on Saturday. I know the Chairwoman of the National Assembly, H.E. Madame Ngan is a great football fan and was there, and I am happy to say that I was also there with my son to see this historic win and join part of the celebrations afterwards. Now allow me to return to this important event.\n\nFollowing a most extensive participatory consultation process, which included many parliamentarians, UN member states adopted the 2030 Agenda in September 2015. This Agenda sets clear, global priorities for sustainable development. The 2030 Agenda includes seventeen inter-linked Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and 169 targets, or specific benchmarks, to be met by 2030 that will mobilize efforts to end all forms of poverty, fight inequalities and tackle issues such as climate change, while ensuring that no one is left behind.\n\nThe Goals are universal, applying to all countries and all people and based on human rights principles. They explicitly recognize that innovative approaches are required to effect change. International collective action, alongside \"whole of government\" and \"whole of society\" interventions are needed. In addition, we need to expand development financing and partnerships (beyond the traditional donor-recipient partnership).\n\nThe SDGs are much more ambitious, universal and have a wider scope than the Millennium Development Goals which they replace. While building on the basic needs and social orientation of the MDGs, the SDGs incorporate economic and environmental sustainability as well as peace, rule of law and institutional strengthening related goals, notably through Goal 16. The SDGs seek to eliminate (rather than reduce) poverty in all its forms, significantly reduce inequalities, eliminate violence against women and children and build peaceful, inclusive, and resilient societies.\n\nI have been pleased to observe Viet Nam's strong commitment to translating the SDGs into actions. This has been a strong commitment of both Madame Chairperson, Madam Vice Chairperson and Deputy Prime Minister Vu Duc Dam, which I have witnessed firsthand in all my conversations with them. And it is a strong and clear testimony to their commitment that they are all here today. This is also evidenced in the government's SDG task force and action plans, as well as in the participation today of other high level leaders from the National Assembly and government ministries. Viet Nam's commitment to the SDGs was also seen through its Voluntary National Review which was presented in July 2018 to the UN's High-level Political Forum on Agenda 2030 in New York which was well received.\n\nWhile the government is a driving force to move the SDGs forward, successful implementation of the SDGs in Viet Nam demands the active engagement of many stakeholders. This conference is the perfect occasion for me to emphasize the crucial role of the National Assembly of Viet Nam in SDG implementation. At the heart of this role is the fact that parliamentarians are representatives of the people, and the SDGs are about people. Recognizing this, UN Member States who adopted the 2030 Agenda explicitly acknowledged the essential role of parliaments \"through their enactment of legislation and adoption of budgets and their role in ensuring accountability for the effective implementation of [the SDG] commitments\". Furthermore, SDG 16's targets demonstrate that effective, accountable and inclusive institutions such as parliaments are crucial for the successful implementation of the 2030 Agenda.\n\nParliamentary engagement in the 2030 Agenda can result in a major boost to achieving the SDGs, including through the creation of an open and transparent mechanism for countries to track their SDG progress, as well as through an increased profile for the SDGs at national, regional and global levels. Parliamentary engagement in the 2030 Agenda should also allow for national policy discussions in a formal political setting that includes multi-stakeholders such as the private sector, civil society organizations and other stakeholders.\n\nMobilizing financial resources will be critical for the successful implementation of the SDGs, and parliaments can play a key role in ensuring that sustainable development priorities are reflected in national, sub-national and local budgets. Ensuring adequate funding for SDG achievement is an important and complex challenge which will require heightened attention moving forward.\n\nFinally, the SDGs will not succeed without strong political will. Members of Parliaments who are in national leadership positions are mandated to not only carry out their duties in parliament, but also to influence other key decision makers and partners to actively champion the SDGs. Your voice and authority can help to ensure that the SDG promise of leaving no one behind becomes a reality in Viet Nam.\n\nDistinguished members of the National Assembly, there are three main entry points for a parliament's engagement:\n\nFirst, the parliament has a specific role in adopting a national legal framework that reflects and localizes the international commitments from the 2030 Agenda, including the establishment of new legislation that responds to critical development challenges. This key role enables the parliament to hold the government accountable for effective policy implementation and national progress on the SDGs, as well as for upholding their international commitments.\n\nFor example, every time a law is reviewed, Members of Parliament can call attention to whether it is consistent with the SDGs and propose amendments if it is not the case.\n\nSecond, the parliament's oversight and accountability functions constitute the second entry point, as Members of Parliament have a key role in monitoring and overseeing the implementation of the 2030 Agenda at the national level. As you monitor the implementation of laws, policies and budgets, I urge you to focus on ensuring that children, women, people with disability, ethnic minorities and other vulnerable segments of society are benefiting equally from Viet Nam's progress, and have equitable opportunities to thrive and prosper.\n\nThird, the entry point for parliamentary engagement relates to its prerogative to analyze and scrutinize the budget, especially to ensure that the state budget is sufficiently allocated and effectively utilized to address disparities in access to quality social services. This is central to leaving no one behind.\n\nMoving forward, there are many monitoring tools that can be used, such as public consultations with key stakeholders, field visits and the establishment of a parliamentary SDG secretariat and working groups to track progress on the roadmap and progress towards the achievement of specific SDGs, in addition to parliamentary debates at national and international levels.\n\nOn this occasion, I'm very pleased to see the conference has a session on the \"Introduction of the IPU-UNDP self-assessment toolkit for SDG oversight and international experiences.\" The toolkit will provide excellent support to parliamentarians to play a critical role in advancing the SDGs. The contents of the toolkit are particularly useful and practical as they guide parliamentarians to perform stronger roles in areas such as: making laws in support of SDGs; financing SDGs; monitoring and providing oversight over SDG implementation, as well as ensuring that the SDGs serve the most vulnerable population.\n\nThe design of the toolkit aims to enable parliamentarians to enhance their ability to engage with the public on SDGs. The key message and purpose of SDGs, 'leave no one behind', is at the core of parliamentarians' roles, and those roles cannot be achieved without engaging with and reaching out to the wider public.\n\nI would like to congratulate Viet Nam's National Assembly on their positive intention and plan to use the toolkit and self-assessment. Self-assessment is not meant to be just a checklist to be ticked. And therefore, I hope that the process will be both substantive and inclusive, and help the National Assembly reflect on how its members can be effective and accountable SDG actors in the future.\n\nThe UN works with many parliaments worldwide, often in cooperation with IPU and other partners. We will be pleased to share experiences from other countries with Viet Nam and to provide customized parliamentary SDG support to help the National Assembly become fit for purpose to implement and monitor the SDGs.\n\nFinally, I wish the very best to distinguished members of the National Assembly in your crucial oversight role of SDG implementation. I trust that you will make important contributions to the effective, efficient and long-term successful implementation of the SDGs in Viet Nam, helping Viet Nam to achieve many of them before the 2030 deadline just like it did with most of their predecessor Millennium Development Goals (the MDGs).\n\nI thank you, ladies and gentlemen, and hope you will have meaningful and action-oriented discussions over the next two days. Xin Cam on."}]}

Allow me to begin by acknowledging the leadership of the Government of Vietnam in responding to Typhoon Yagi and in guiding the recovery efforts since the disaster struck nine months ago.\n\nTyphoon Yagi left an indelible mark on Viet Nam. With 345 lives lost or missing, homes destroyed, and livelihoods disrupted, the storm tested the resilience of communities and the strength of our systems. The total economic loss—equivalent to 0.7% of the country’s GDP in 2024—underscored the far-reaching impact of climate-related shocks. In the face of such adversity, what emerged was a clear example of collaborative disaster response and recovery led by the Government and supported by our collective efforts through the Disaster Risk Reduction Partnership (DRRP).\n\nOne of our key contributions was the development of the Joint Response Plan (JRP). This plan not only laid out sectoral priorities across humanitarian and early recovery needs but also provided a common framework for resource mobilization.\n\nA major emphasis was placed on early recovery. Shelter, water, sanitation, and health services were among the first sectors addressed. Particular attention was given to reaching marginalized and at-risk groups—including ethnic minorities, female-headed households, and persons with disabilities—who were disproportionately affected by the storm. In line with the Leave No One Behind principle, our collective action targeted those who often remain on the margins of large-scale responses.\n\nAnother important pillar of the response was the management of financial resources. One lesson from the emergency phase was the urgent need for robust information systems for tracking aid flows and program delivery. Urgently at that moment, the Pooled fund under the UN’s emergency coordination mechanism proved instrumental in enabling timely and flexible support to frontline partners.\n\nColleagues, as we reflect on Typhoon Yagi, one message stands out above all others: climate shocks are intensifying. The increasing frequency and severity of extreme weather events in Viet Nam demands a step change in how we prepare—not just how we respond.\n\nThe experience of Yagi compels us to take preparedness more seriously:\n\nThis workshop, by including the review of Decree No. 50 on international emergency aid, presents an opportunity to strengthen the enabling environment for future crises. The challenges of Yagi showed us the gaps. Now we must work together to find solutions.\n\nI would like to sincerely commend the Vietnam Disaster and Dyke Management Authority for their leadership. Your efforts in convening this workshop demonstrate a continued commitment to learning, accountability, and proactive disaster risk governance.\n\nThe strong coordination between Government agencies and international partners through the DRRP has been a model of collaboration. The value of this platform is its ability to bring together humanitarian actors, development partners, and the private sector, in support of national priorities.\n\nLet me close by thank all DRRP members, line ministries, and local partners who have contributed to the Yagi response and recovery. Your work has saved lives, restored dignity, and paved the way for a more resilient Viet Nam.\n\nLet this workshop serve as a turning point—from recovery to resilience, from reflection to readiness.\n\nThank you, and I look forward to our shared discussions today.\n\nXin cảm ơn ./."}]}

It has been a long but, I believe, a fruitful day, full of frank and critical exchanges and most importantly a willingness to share and improve on the work so far. While I have not been able to attend all of today, I have been getting updates from colleagues, including during lunch time.\n\nThe consultation today, with the presence of Government representatives and experts from NGOs, development partners and the UN was fruitful and useful. I am very happy that the UN was able to bring you all together today, both physically and virtually, in this inclusive and participatory forum to further improve the CCA. The discussions have no doubt provided us with plenty of perspectives and human resources on which we will be leaning in order to enrich and deepen the initial analysis.\n\nAllow me to reiterate the key objectives of this consultation. It was to discuss and solicit feedback from stakeholders on the scope, depth, relevance, practicality and coherence of key findings in the CCA draft prepared by the UN. It was also to garner views, opinions and critical perspectives on key priorities and gaps and to strengthen the evidence base to ensure that the CCA adequately captures what it is intended to.\n\nThe morning session, I believe, illuminated some key blind spots and areas that we can zoom in on to strengthen and strategically structure the analysis. For example, we need to further emphasize the multi-dimensional risks emerging which are reinforcing and compounding different issues for vulnerable groups. These include the impact of COVID-19, natural disasters and economic and social challenges that will leave the most vulnerable groups further behind if not prioritized. The rural and urban divide is another critical issue that also, if addressed, has the potential to significantly reduce inequalities as well as accelerate achievement of the SDGs. It is the rural areas where progress on leaving no one behind is most necessary and urgent.\n\nOn people-centered social development, data, financing, poverty and social protection remain key concerns for Vietnam and deserve a deeper analysis especially in the context of discrimination – which groups have been left out and also why? Health and nutrition were highlighted, particularly gaps in investment across the health sector, an overload at tertiary levels and increased out of pocket spending. Education, youth, child protection as well as gender issues were discussed comprehensively, with participants sharing critical insights that will help us strengthen the analysis.\n\nOn Economic transformation, the discussions revealed a need to deepen the analysis on inclusive growth and multidimensional aspects of economic development more specifically concerning the poor, smallholder farmers, and those living in rural areas. Digital transformation, the improvement of FDI quality and linkages with domestic firms as well as green growth and enhanced competitiveness were also highlighted as transformational areas that need to be better considered in the CCA report. Increasing institutional capacity at various levels and addressing institutional barriers should also be emphasized further since this will be critical to ensuring all policies and strategies are successfully implemented. This is an area that we will be examining more closely as we refine the CCA analysis.\n\nI am told that the discussions on government and justice were very illuminating, with participants sharing that there were some areas where the description of laws was lacking, and that there are discrepancies between the global and national frameworks for monitoring SDG achievement which need to be bridged. This will be important in ensuring that the analysis better reflects these differences whilst providing useful information for future discussions between the Government and the United Nations. There were additional challenges elaborated, such as supporting groups that currently have limited representation in governance processes, especially youth, women and the LGBTI community.\n\nOn Environment and Climate Change, greening the economy was high on the list of priorities as well as a consideration of the national integrated risk management framework which participants noted is currently fragmented. A stronger focus on the climate, health and environment nexus would be of value in the analysis and a more in-depth consideration of water and greening the economy.\n\nIn the afternoon, cross-cutting issues were focused on prioritizing four areas: youth, gender, financing and transboundary issues which are specifically important for Leave No One Behind perspectives. Many useful ideas were captured, and we are beginning to better understand what you all view as important cross-cutting issues that need to be addressed, and also cross-cutting issues that intersect across topics we had not previously explored in-depth. These will provide a more comprehensive view of cross-cutting issues in Viet Nam.\n\nNow, our remaining tasks will include reviewing today’s meeting outcomes, addressing them and finalizing the draft CCA report in 2021. As noted in my opening remarks, the final CCA will be a guide for the UN’s work in supporting the government and people of Viet Nam. It will help inform the next Cooperation Framework for the period 2022 to 2026. I am reassured after the consultation that the next version of the CCA will cover a much more comprehensive discussion of sustainable development challenges in Viet Nam benefiting from the rich discussion today.\n\nIn terms of a timeline, today’s meeting kicks off a series of smaller more targeted consultations we will also be having on the CCA between now and its finalization probably in March 2021. Please note once again, that this CCA Report will be a living document which will be updated as Viet Nam marks critical milestones of development in the future. We look forward to continuing to work closely with you to ensure that the CCA reflects the UN’s commitment to making sure that no one is left behind.\n\nI highly appreciate the participation of everyone—both online and in-person—for bringing in your expertise and perspectives, which as I mentioned before is central to improving the quality integrity of this report. Last but not least, I would like to thank every moderator, presenter and the rapporteurs for playing key roles in making this consultation the success it appears to have been.\n\nYour presence and representation reflect and resonate with the theme of the United Nations this year as we have been commemorating the 75th anniversary of its establishment. The most important global priority of UN75 was to “listen to the people” in order to ensure no one is left behind. I would like to reassure you that the UN stands ready to continue doing this and will continue to convene and provide such platforms and spaces. I also hope that you will continue to stay committed to actively partnering with the UN in Viet Nam.\n\nThank you! Xin cảm ơn!"}]}

Congratulations. I am happy to speak on behalf of the UN family in Viet Nam on this occasion, sharing with you our very special partnership journey in Viet Nam’s development over more than 40 years – a journey in which IFAD has been a crucial participant.\n\nAs you know, our main mission in Viet Nam is to support the country in the implementation of Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development. To achieve this mission, we have prioritized more and more joint inter-agency collaboration and partnerships with the government, civil society, the private sector and international development partners in Viet Nam. The UN convenes platforms for policy debates, policy formulation and advocacy, as well as shares best global development practices and technical expertise with both national partners and local communities.\n\nOur joint UN Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) work and support to Viet Nam, guided by the One Strategic Plan for 2017 – 2021 jointly agreed with the Government of Viet Nam, focuses on 4 main areas:\n\nIFAD has actively contributed to our UN Country Team’s Result Areas on Climate Change and Environment as well as on Inclusive Growth and Social Protection. In particular, IFAD contributes to the promotion of sustainable rural development through increased rural household incomes, especially by economically empowering many women and ethnic minority people in provinces across northern, central and southern Viet Nam.\n\nIFAD’s microloans to women and vulnerable groups in rural areas have been innovative and proven to be very effective in empowering people to change their own lives.\n\nIFAD-supported programs today impressively cover 392 communes in 67 districts in 11 provinces – reaching 1.7 million people. The programs assisted 367,000 poor and near-poor households to escape poverty, amongst whom 45% are women and 49% are from ethnic minority groups.\n\nWorking on the strategic level of SDG implementation in Viet Nam, IFAD has aligned its objectives of No Poverty, No Hunger and Climate Action with Gender Equality with the country’s national strategy frameworks targeting new rural development and market-led pro-poor agricultural growth to sustainably improve the incomes of smallholders and the rural poor through market participation and reduced climate vulnerability.\n\nNatural disasters and climate change have severe impacts on Viet Nam’s rural and agricultural development. The UN is happy that IFAD is strategically assisting Viet Nam to:\n\nExcellences, Ladies and Gentlemen,\n\nViet Nam has undergone impressive economic development over the last three decades, but not all people have benefited, and many are still left behind, mostly in rural areas. Investing in people to ensure social inclusion and breaking the cycle of poverty will be key to achieving the quality, inclusiveness and sustainability of economic growth that is necessary for the achievement of Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development in Viet Nam.\n\nSignificant development finance resources for the implementation of sustainable development in agriculture and rural areas also needs to be mobilized if Agenda 2030 is to be achieved. IFAD’s micro-finance lending which reaches millions of small rural householders, especially women and ethnic minorities, greatly contributes to the UN SDG agenda and our One Strategic Plan, as well as to Viet Nam’s national Socio-Economic Development Plan (SEDP) and Socio-Economic Development Strategy (SEDS), and more broadly to the continued cooperation and partnership between the UN and the Government and people of Viet Nam.\n\nAs UN Resident Coordinator, I look forward to both supporting and witnessing the continued growth and contribution of IFAD’s important work in Viet Nam over the next few years!\n\nThank you! Xin cảm ơn!"}]}

It is impossible to thank all institutions and persons who have contributed to UNFPA's mandate in Viet ­­­Nam over the past forty years, but I would like to mention our longstanding partners, the Parliamentary Committee for Social Affairs, the Ministry of Health, the General Office for Population and Family Planning, the Ministry of Planning and Investment, the General Office for Statistics, the Ministry of Labour, Invalids and Social Affairs, the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism, the Ministry of Home Affairs, the Central Committee on Popularization and Education, the Vietnam Fatherland Front and other social organizations, especially in the area of Women's Rights, our sister organizations at the UN, and the bilateral partners that have supported and continue to support our work.\n\nNaturally, over the past 40 years, UNFPA's collaborations have changed and matured over time, according to the stages of development Viet Nam has undergone, and, simultaneous with the evolution of United Nations agreements and mechanisms relevant for UNFPA's dual mandate in population and development, and sexual and reproductive health and rights. Allow me to very briefly mention some important milestones and results.\n\nIn 1977, the Government of Viet Nam and UNFPA established the first Joint Cooperative Programme. Since then, our collaboration has gone through nine 5-year country cooperation programmes, with nearly one hundred projects implemented at all levels, from the central to commune levels (in 12 provinces). UNFPA has provided more than 190 million USD of financial support to Viet Nam, together with a large amount of technical support to the Government and key national stakeholders, to improve people's access to quality sexual and reproductive health services, collect high-quality population data, address gender equality, and build national capacity in development, implementation and monitoring of evidence-based policies related to sexual and reproductive health, population and development, and gender equality.\n\nWith zero tolerance for women dying in childbirth, UNFPA is particularly proud to have been associated with Viet Nam's spectacular achievements in addressing the unmet needs of both women and men for contraceptives, and improving maternal health, resulting in the tremendously gratifying accomplishment of Millennium Development Goal 5.\n\nIn a related field of action, and in line with Viet Nam's longstanding commitment to gender equality, UNFPA has been supportive in advancing the agenda of gender equality and women's empowerment. UNFPA has successfully supported the Government in addressing the root causes of gender inequality, combating gender-based violence and the imbalance of the sex ratio at birth. In addition, UNFPA has helped to raise the awareness of the general public as well as to promote civil society participation and strengthen the capacity of key implementation partners in this field by establishing a national coordination mechanism for domestic violence prevention.\n\nUNFPA's mandate also includes Population and Development. Population data and evidence is critical for development. Without accurate data, policymakers would not know the most urgent areas in which to invest in schools, hospitals and roads, and those most in need might remain invisible. From the 1980s, UNFPA assisted the General Statistical Office of Viet Nam to conduct all population censuses and other large-scale population-based which provided quality data that were crucial for developing policies and programmes to foster the country's economic growth, social justice and a measure of access to human rights. From in-depth studies of these surveys, better knowledge about special groups in the population have emerged. Through the analysis of population data, the needs and potential of women, youth and adolescents, migrants, as well as an understanding of SRB, demographic dividend and population ageing, have become available to act upon with targeted human rights-based policies.\n\nThe close collaboration between UNFPA and the Government reflected in the development of national strategies on health, population and family planning, the law on domestic violence, the National Strategy and Programme of Action on Gender Equality, and the Statistical Strategy.\n\nOver the last decade, there have been dramatic changes in Viet Nam's population dynamics, particularly the change in population structure. Right now, Viet Nam is experiencing a demographic bonus that offers an unprecedented socio-economic development opportunity. But, at the same time, the population is ageing rapidly, posing serious challenges to the country's social protection system, and the economy in general. People live longer, which is an achievement in itself, but in combination with a low fertility rate, well under replacement levels in some regions, doesn't bode well for development in the longer term. In response, at present, UNFPA is working with the Government, the National Assembly, and the Party, as well as other stakeholders, to develop a draft of a Population Law that is rights-based, recognizing all reproductive rights, and that applies a life cycle approach towards these emerging demographic and development challenges.\n\nAs we move towards a future in which the One UN structure enables UN funds and agencies to expand their scope and work closer together for the achievement of Agenda 2030, and Viet Nam shapes its path as a middle income country, the longstanding collaboration between UNFPA and Viet Nam will remain dynamic and responsive to the technical needs of the Government, private sector, social organizations and other development partners.\n\nAs we celebrate the 40th anniversary of our collaboration and partnership, I am confident that the alliance between UNFPA and Viet Nam will continue to thrive. I'm delighted to be here to reaffirm our continuing commitment to \"delivering a world where every pregnancy is wanted, every childbirth is safe and every young person's potential is fulfilled\".\n\nToday, I am very happy to see so many people who have collaborated with UNFPA  over the past 40 years. Among all of us here, some of you may have already retired, but many of you are still very young. One the youngest persons who joined us today is Miss Tuong Anh, a ten year old girl who was interviewed in 2016 for UNFPA's Global Publication focusing on investing in adolescents girls. Today's 10-year-old girl will be 24 when the United Nations' new development agenda, Agenda 2030 come to fruition. That development agenda aims for the world where every single person has opportunities to fulfill her or his potential – in a world that leaves no one behind.\n\nOn behalf of UNFPA, all the present Staff and those who came before us, I would like to thank you sincerely for your dedication and hard work in making the first 40 Years of Collaboration an extraordinary success. Thank you, and wishing you all health, happiness and continued progress!\n\nXin cam on!"}]}
