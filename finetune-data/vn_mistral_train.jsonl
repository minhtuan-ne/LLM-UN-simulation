Convey that we stand in solidarity with the Government and people of Viet Nam in advancing sustainable, resilient, and inclusive development.\n\nConvey that the United Nations Country Team (UNCT) provides integrated and coordinated support for Viet Nam’s climate action agenda. Through the joint Government of Viet Nam and UN Cooperation Framework (2022-2026), we have prioritized that“by 2026, people in Viet Nam, especially those at risk of being left behind, will benefit from and contribute to a safer and cleaner environment resulting from Viet Nam’s effective mitigation and adaptation to climate change, disaster-risk reduction and resilience building, promotion of a circular economy, provision of clean and renewable energy, and sustainable management of natural resources.”\n\nHighlight particular attention to those most vulnerable to climate change, including rural women, children and adolescents, persons with disabilities and ethnic minorities whose lives, livelihoods, health and wellbeing are increasingly at risk.\n\nInform that on 22 July, the UN SG delivered a “moment of opportunity” speech[1]on climate action, which underscored the urgency of aligning Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) with the 1.5 degree target agreed at the Paris COP. Note that the UN SG emphasized the need for national climate plans to cover all emissions, across the entire economy; and integrate energy, climate and sustainable development priorities into one coherent vision.\n\nStress that the UN SG called for specific action on 6 opportunity areas:\n\nNote that Viet Nam is well-positioned to seize these 6 opportunities: with its strong and long-term commitment to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, participation in JETP and through its most updated NDC 3.0.\n\nRecognize that delivering on this commendable ambition requires solid multiple partnerships, substantial financing, private investment, technology transfer and capacity building – not only to meet the net-zero emission goals but ensure a just transition where no one is left behind\n\nInform that specifically on the national climate plan (NDC 3.0), the UNCT presents a collective offer of technical and policy assistance to help advance Viet Nam’s NDCs following the Government led approach. Our shared ambition is to make the NDC inclusive and just for the most vulnerable, more ambitious, and fully aligned with both national development priorities and global climate goals.\n\nExpress hope that UN support for an inclusive NDC and integration of health priorities will add value to Viet Nam’s NDC plan and help prevent escalating climate changes and risks. This may be achieved through among others: greener technology and transport, improvements in climate smart agricultural production and deforestation, as well asintegration of child-sensitive risk analysis to ensure social service systems, and community services can withstand climate shocks.\n\nRecognize that climate change and disasters increasingly threaten lives, livelihoods and health of the people, reinforcing the need for shock-responsive social protection, particularly with the recentstorms, floods, landslides, heatwaves, and air pollution occurrence. Our concerns grow especially for vulnerable groups including children, women, persons with disabilities, and ethnic minorities.\n\nConvey that this courtesy meeting also follows up on the letter dated 21 July 2025 from the Secretary-General of the United Nations to His Excellency Mr. Lương Cường, State President of Viet Nam. The letter extends a formal invitation to the State President to participate in the high-level climate event co-convened by the UN Secretary-General and the President of the Federative Republic of Brazil, scheduled for 24 September 2025 at UN Headquarters. Express hope that Viet Nam will use this moment to announce its updated NDC aligned with the 1.5°C target, setting a bold example for others.\n\nThe United Nations, through joint initiatives including UNDP’s Climate Promise and the work of other UN agencies such as UNICEF, WHO, FAO, ILO, UNESCO, UNFPA, UN Women and UN Habitat remain committed to accelerating climate ambition and implementation in Viet Nam. We emphasize a whole-of-society and whole-of-UN approach to drive impactful and inclusive change.\n\nOn the NDC 3.0 specifically, the UN stands ready to support the development of NDC 3.0 and is committed to assisting the Government in implementing priority climate actions in the years ahead.\n\nRecognize that climate action is about safeguarding people and planet resource to benefit current and future generations. Therefore, climate action is deeply interconnected with other priority sectors – such as among others in agriculture. For instance, advancing the food systems transformation agenda, ensures that Viet Nam’s efforts on climate are reinforced by more sustainable, resilient, and inclusive agrifood systems. The UN stands ready to support Viet Nam in scaling up nature-based solutions, circular economy approaches in agrifood systems, and resilient livelihoods.\n\nOffer to, among others:\n\nSeek Minister’s guidance on how best the UNCT can tailor and align our support to Viet Nam’s climate ambitions, ensuring our cooperation is responsive, meaningful, and future-focused.\n\nWelcome further opportunities to explore avenues to further deepen GoV-UN partnership for transformative climate action.\n\n[1]Secretary-General's remarks on Climate Action \"A Moment of Opportunity: Supercharging the Clean Energy Age\" [as delivered; scroll down for All-French] | United Nations Secretary-General"}]}

Resettlement could exacerbate pre-existing challenges and inequalities faced by those who are already in marginalized or difficult situation based on their gender, ethnic origin, socio-economic background, age or health status.\n\nIn 2015, States agreed on the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, consisting of universal, indivisible and rights-based 17 Sustainable Development Goals with a promise to \"leave no one behind\". Significantly, the new global agenda established a standalone goal on gender equality. Goal 5 on \"Achieving gender equality and empowering all women and girls\" aims at:\n\n• Ending discrimination and violence against women and girls;\n\n• Recognizing women's unpaid care and domestic work;\n\n• Ensuring women's full and effective participation and leadership;\n\n• Realizing universal access to sexual and reproductive health and rights; and\n\n• Ensuring women's rights to economic resources including access to ownership and control over land.\n\nIn addition, the targets in other goals cover a comprehensive set of issues, including the gender dimensions of poverty, housing, employment, water and sanitation, health, education, safety and peace and security.\n\nAll of these are very much linked to the topic of this conference as gender disparities that exist in society and the family tend to become worse in situations of displacement and resettlement. In a scenario in which the community suffers negative consequences of enforced change, women's position both outside the family and inside become even more precarious, including with respect to increased risk of facing violence.\n\nWhile Viet Nam has significantly reduced poverty and made advances in many development indicators, its gains have not necessarily translated into the enhancement of human capacities for all or greater gender equality for all. Data show major challenges remaining in rural areas where nearly 90 per cent of the labour force, especially females, have no access to training. A large share of women farmers work as unpaid family workers which are the most vulnerable form of employment. Women in general have limited access to and control over land, resources, information and technology. In the family and community, men still play a leading role in making important decisions, and women bear disproportionate burden of unpaid care and domestic work.\n\nTo safeguard the rights and interests of people, particularly the more vulnerable and marginalized, all development induced displacement and resettlement should take a human-rights based and gender-responsive approach. This requires transparency and accountability to be in place before, during and after resettlement.\n\nFor transparency, we need data and information to be accessible. Individuals and communities must have access to appropriate data, documents and intellectual resources that impact upon their rights. Having access to appropriate data means being informed about the policies and plans for resettlement, compensation, availability of social services and economic resources as well as other factors that affect their rights. At the same time, it is crucial to collect data disaggregated by gender, age, ethnic or religious groups, minorities and household types to closely monitor their situation and take corrective measures when necessary.\n\nIn order to hold stakeholders accountable to the women that will be affected by development projects, we need greater participation and representation of women in local development planning and decision making. The responsibilities of respecting, protecting and fulfilling human rights through development not only belongs to the government but also to the private sector that may be taking part in development projects, and development partners including the United Nations. In this context, civil society organizations formed by women and representing the interests of women play a crucial role in making development gender-responsive through closely monitoring development outcomes for women and girls and using evidence to hold duty-bearers to account.\n\nLadies and gentlemen,\n\nThe promise to \"leave no one behind\" under the Sustainable Development Agenda 2030 can only be realized when all women and girls live a life free from discrimination and can enjoy the development outcomes on the same basis as men and boys.\n\nViet Nam has ratified many international treaties on human rights, and was in fact one of the first countries to ratify the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women in 1982. The periodic review by the human rights treaty bodies provide critical guidance to accelerate Viet Nam's progress towards realizing gender equality and women's rights. For this, I would like to call your attention to the most recent Concluding Observations by the CEDAW Committee adopted in 2015 which expresses concern over negative effects of resettlement programmes in the context of development projects on rural women.\n\nThe endline of 2030 is approaching fast and it is time for us to step up our efforts to translate our commitments into real change for women.\n\nFor this, we can start by prioritizing investments in gender equality in all areas and all sectors, from rural development and agriculture to health, education, water and sanitation, social protection and infrastructure development. Every step of planning, decision-making, policy action, budgeting and monitoring must reflect the needs of women and men in their diversity and benefit all women and girls.\n\nI hope this conference will serve as a platform to exchange knowledge, good practices and learnings from other countries and from within Viet Nam, so that at the end of the two-day conference, all of us will have a concrete set of recommendations to take away.\n\nUN Women remains committed to contributing towards enhancing women's rights and gender equality in Viet Nam.\n\nXin Cam on."}]}

My interventions will:\n\nFirst, appreciate the strengths of disaster management system and recognize important achievements to date.\n\nSecond, share some lessons learned.\n\nAnd third, highlight areas for continued attention.\n\n[We are all aware that] Viet Nam is one of the most hazard-prone countries in the Asia-Pacific Region and ranked among the top five globally likely to be most impacted by climate change. 70% of Viet Nam’s population live in coastal communities and are highly exposed to extreme weather events and sea level rise due to climate change. Those who depend on agriculture are also at greater risk from more frequent drought and water scarcity. Economic activities linked with natural environment and ecosystems, such as in fisheries and tourism, will suffer more climate related loss and damages.\n\nThe Government is actively addressing these challenges. Since the enactment of the Law on Natural Disaster Prevention and Control in 2013, Viet Nam has further systematized its Disaster Risk Management (DRM) and disaster response capability. A multi-agency and hierarchical model for disaster management is in place, which also incorporates elements of Community-Based Disaster Risk Management (CBDRM). Government coordination -- at national and local levels -- is effective.\n\nViet Nam’s successful response to the 2020 historical flooding in the central region and last year to Super Typhoon Noru demonstrates a maturing of the country’s disaster management system.\n\nI congratulate the Government of Viet Nam, the National Steering Committee, including the MARD, VNDMA and local authorities for the leadership and strong focus on leaving no one behind.\n\nWhat have we learned? Some lessons:\n\nNotwithstanding the effectiveness of disaster management efforts to-date, we need to be ready, adaptive and agile to respond to multiple crises. The COVID-19 pandemic has taught us this lesson well. We are learning that risks are highly interconnected, multi-dimensional and increasing in severity. With climate change, disaster impacts are exceeding society’s ability to absorb shocks and recover quickly.\n\nHow can we further enhance disaster management to achieve risk-informed development?\n\nAdopt a multi-dimensional approach to avoid siloes in risk management. Strengthen prevention and anticipatory action to increase society’s ability to cope with shocks. Could there be consideration for linking anticipatory action with social protection systems? With predicted increase frequency and severity of extreme weather events and slow onset crises, existing social assistance programs need to be more shock responsive.\n\nA focus on prevention and risk-informed development also means shared responsibility and accountability for risk prevention. Building community resilience linked to climate commitments and the SDGs, investing in climate-and disaster-resilient infrastructure, and shock-responsive social protection systems with adequate financing are critical elements. More importantly, shared accountability for risk prevention requires a new social contract, where the responsibility for disaster management prevention rests not only on one response agency but spreads to key socio-economic sectors most affected by the risks.\n\nMuch work remains to be done. But we are stronger together.\n\nThank you! Xin cảm ơn!"}]}

I start with a quote from the UN Secretary General, António Guterres, who said --\n\n\"The future is being built in the cloud. It must be powered by the sun, the wind, and the promise of a better world.\"\n\nThis quote captures what green transition must look like in a digital era.\n\nWe stand at a unique and defining moment in history. In the ten years since the Paris Agreement was adopted, renewable energy technologies have undergone a remarkable transformation -- paving the way for rapid and widespread transition from energy systems dominated by fossil fuels to homegrown, low-cost renewables.\n\nIf we follow the money, we see that and I quote the UN Secretary General, “the sun is rising on a clean energy age,”with “USD2 trillion going into clean energy last year– USD800 billion more than fossil fuels, and up almost 70% in ten years.”\n\nWhat we are seeing in the energy transition is“not just a shift in power… but a shift in possibility … in repairing our relationship with the climate.”\n\nFor the UN, the transformation is fundamentally about energy security and people’s security. It’s about smart economics. It’s about decent jobs, public health, advancing the Sustainable Development Goals. And delivering clean and affordable energy to everyone, everywhere.\n\nDigital technologies, at the same time, are fundamentally changing the way we live, consume, entertain and relate to each other. Two billion people shop online with e-commerce platforms. Three billion people play online video games. Four billion are connected on social media.\n\nThe numbers are impressive. Digital transformation is now a structural driver. Digitization is a central economic force, reshaping jobs, industry and services. Access to digital infrastructure is key to unlocking economic and social opportunities. Many nations now prioritize digital transformation, through infrastructure, technology, and regulation, to secure future prosperity.\n\nOur greatest collective challenge, however, is connecting these two transformations into a twin transition: the simultaneous shift toward a green and a digitally enabled economy. These two transitions reinforce, shape, and increasingly depend on one another.\n\nWe are already witnessing green transition and climate actions powered by digital technologies that improve climate modelling, resource efficiency, and energy management. At the same time, the digital transition must be powered by clean, sustainable energy.\n\nCountries that align climate ambition with digital innovation are strengthening competitiveness, reducing vulnerabilities, attracting investment, and creating high-quality jobs. For Viet Nam, this twin transition represents a major strategic opportunity to sustain high growth, deepen resilience, and move up the value chains.\n\nWhat are the regional and global shifts shaping green and digital transformations?  I cite 3:\n\nFirst, climate action is changing rapidly because of advanced data systems and Artificial Intelligence (AI). These are used to create more accurate climate modelling to improve disaster prediction and early warning.\n\nAt the same time, digital technologies can increase emissions due to rising energy demand. In the adoption of theGlobal Digital Compact, member states acknowledged that digital cooperation must support environmental sustainability across the entire lifecycle of technologies, from production to use to disposal.\n\nWhat does this mean for Viet Nam?UN ESCAP identifies Viet Nam as one of the Asia–Pacific region’s most climate-vulnerable economies. The World Bank calculated that Viet Nam lost USD10 billion in 2020 (or 3.2% of GDP) to climate change. Stronger early-warning systems for storms, floods, and landslides can reduce this cost.\n\nSecond, digitalization is transforming energy systems globally\n\nDigital technologies evolve electricity grids from one-directional systems into responsive, multi-directional energy networks. Smart meters, sensors and AI-enabled control systems improve real-time balancing, reduce losses, and increase reliability.\n\nAcross the world, households and firms generate their own power through rooftop solar, batteries or mini-grids. Digital platforms are essential to coordinate two-way power flows and integrate distributed renewable energy efficiently.\n\nIn Viet Nam, Resolution 70 offers starting points to leverage digital transformation for modernizing the energy system. Viet Nam aims to develop a national energy information system and database. This is the foundation for data and AI-driven energy planning and forecasting.\n\nResolution 70 also aims for rapid growth in rooftop solar for self-consumption and energy storage. This will require regional interconnection and require smarter, digitally enabled grid management.\n\nThird, the world faces the risk of an unsustainable (dirty) digital transformation.\n\nThe digital sector’s environmental footprint is expanding quickly: data centres, crypto mining and AI computing often rely on fossil-based electricity. A typical AI data data-center eats-up as much electricity as 100,000 homes, and by 2030 data centers will consume as much energy as Japan.\n\nGlobal concerns are also rising about e-waste, mineral extraction and labour conditions in digital supply chains. Only 22.3% of e-waste is formally collected and recycled in an environmentally sound manner. Often waste is imported to Southeast Asia and the Middle East under misleading trade codes with severe environmental impact.\n\nFurther, efficiency gains risk triggering “rebound effects,” where increased consumption outweighs sustainability benefits. This reinforces the need for responsible digital policy and regulation.\n\n[PAUSE]\n\nTo bring the vision of accelerating green transition and leveraging digital technologies as dual engines for inclusive, resilient and sustainable growth in Viet Nam, the UN, together with the Government, embarked on amacro modelling exercise.\n\nThe modeling specifically measured impacts of government investments in renewable energy, digital infrastructure and social sectors on GDP growth, poverty rate and CO2 emissions.\n\nThe findings from our joint study make a compelling case for accelerating green transition in a digital era.\n\nHow? Three key findings:\n\nOne, investing in renewable energy would likely help Viet Nam to achieve the targets for renewable energy development, reducing CO2 emissions and improving air quality, as well as economic growth.  In view of the huge value of investments involved, there would likely be a surge in public debt, however, if the investments were to be financed mainly by the Government.\n\nTwo, investing in human capital and energy efficient infrastructure has positive economic and social effects. These drive GDP growth, reduce poverty and inequality, reduce CO2 emissions and pollution, and improve the government’s fiscal space. The study shows that GDP growth benefits of investing in people and green infrastructure are greater than potential government debt increase.\n\nThird, investing in information, communication and technology (ICT) infrastructure (or digital transformation) has a positive effect on GDP growth (by at least 2%) as well as on poverty reduction and inequality.\n\nThe modelling demonstrates the importance of inclusive fiscal policy in support of the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals. The most fundamental is the need to maintain adequate public spending on three major development areas – health, education and social protection. Enhancing the access to, and the quality of, these public services will directly benefit vulnerable populations, including people living in remote, ethnic minority regions -- areas frequently affected by climate-related disasters -- and thus promote socioeconomic equality in the long term. It also shows that the pressures on the government’s fiscal space subside over time because the economic and development benefits outweigh the costs.\n\nWhile financing is the key means of implementation, a predictable and integrated policy framework, as well as investments in skills development and enabling infrastructure are critical.\n\nThrough an integrated policy framework, that breaks down the silos between green and digital transitions, Viet Nam can set predictable, clear policy targets. It can harmonize policy instruments such as fiscal incentives. It can also ensure robust inter-ministerial coordination. The nationally determined contributions (NDC 3.0) can be a good starting point for policy alignment.\n\nMeanwhile, with Viet Nam rapidly approaching upper-middle-income country status, it will need to increasingly rely on domestic resources and private capital to finance its development needs. With the growing economy, the country can enhance tax revenue collection and progressiveness while adopting innovative and blended finance models. Reforming domestic capital market is necessary to enhance its role in attracting international capital and channeling domestic savings into digital and green sectors.\n\nThe macro-modelling underlines that navigating a balance between prudent public debt management and achievement of long-term development goals is essential. How investments in development priorities are financed in terms of size, composition and pace has a direct impact on public debt. This emphasizes the importance of calibration of the financing strategy, approach and mobilization of various sources of finance, including private capital.\n\nAs Viet Nam continues on its path of economic development and integration, and with the country’s rise to the new era, the UN appreciates that the insights gleaned from this study already served as an input to the 14th Party Congress deliberations.\n\nDuring the recent visit of the UN Secretary General to Hanoi – he advised that in a dynamic and rapidly growing Viet Nam, the UN should become a “laboratory” for the twin green and digital transformations. He himself will be very keen to learn from our experience – how Viet Nam’s future is being built in the cloud, while being powered by the sun, the wind, and the promise of a better world.\n\nXin cam on!"}]}

Those efforts in the HIV response have already paid off: thanks to prevention and effective treatment, between 2000 and 2016, we estimate that nearly half a million new HIV infections and nearly 150,000 AIDS-related deaths were averted in Viet Nam.\n\nAlmost half of all people living with HIV in Viet Nam are on HIV treatment allowing them to enjoy a longer and productive life and take care of their families.\n\nHowever, this means that more than half of PLHIV who very much need HIV treatment do not get it. AIDS is not over yet. With still about 11,000 new HIV infections and 8,000 AIDS-related deaths every year, Viet Nam still faces a major public health threat: HIV is among the top infectious diseases with highest disease burden for the Vietnamese people. Though every new HIV infection is preventable and especially for mother to child transmission, every year a few hundred Vietnamese infants are born with HIV. Young people’s knowledge on HIV remains limited. The younger generation, whom Viet Nam’s future relies on, is still thus much at risk of HIV and progress could be reversed.\n\nThe HIV epidemic and response are uneven across the country and, the evidence shows, become more serious in certain areas and among some key populations.  This complex dynamic requires continued determination and a well-adapted response.\n\nGovernment leaders have emphasized that no one should be left behind in Viet Nam as the country strives for social and economic development targets, placing people and social justice at the center. Investing in the HIV response will not only ensure that no one is left behind and at risk without access to HIV information and services, but will also enable more people living with HIV to be part of the national solutions, from the highest to the community level, towards ending AIDS.\n\nA great example is Madame Pham Thi Hue, a woman living with HIV leading for many years, a positive life as a role model, inspiring and helping many other people living with HIV for the better including through counseling and support.\n\nMore than ever, Viet Nam needs to sustain strong political commitment and increase domestic investment including for qualified human resources for HIV prevention and quality treatment to maintain the hard-gained achievements and further scale up services, fast tracking the national HIV response toward ending AIDS by 2030.\n\nDistinguished leaders and guests,\n\nThe stakes are high. Failure to renew political commitment to HIV and sufficiently invest in the HIV response in the existing  window of opportunity would imply significantly higher human and financial costs later as the virus will spread further and drug resistance would increase putting at risk Viet Nam’s chance to fully control the epidemic. Several Asian countries and, especially cities, have seen a rebound of new HIV infections.\n\nYou can choose the right path and it is actually a good investment. Indeed, the HIV Investment Case developed by the Government in collaboration with development partners and civil society pointed out that for each dollar of efficient investment in HIV today, Viet Nam will gain at least 8 dollars in return and be able to end AIDS as a public health threat for the Vietnamese people by 2030.\n\nInvest now in the right interventions at the right locations for the right populations will help Viet Nam do more with less and we have now better data than ever to do so.\n\nThough we will continue to support Viet Nam to mobilize external support, in the context of fast reduction of donor funding for HIV due to Viet Nam’s strong economic development, and with a view to further ensure the sustainability of the HIV response, towards the Sustainable Development Goals on ending AIDS and ending poverty, HIV should be integrated in the national and provincial socio-economic development plans.  This is a shared responsibility for both the central and provincial governments.\n\nI believe that with the strong leadership of the National Committee on AIDS, your  strong support as people’s elected representatives, with the available innovations in the HIV science and the partnerships of community-based and social organizations and development partners, Viet Nam will be able to turn into reality its commitment to the 90-90-90 targets -- 90% of people living with HIV knowing their status, 90% of all people diagnosed with HIV receiving HIV treatment and 90% of people receiving HIV treatment having viral load suppression. This is the path towards ending AIDS by 2030, the commitment Viet Nam and all other UN Member States made in the Political Declaration on HIV and AIDS in 2016.\n\nUNAIDS together with other UN agencies and development partners continues to spare no efforts to support Viet Nam’s fast track efforts towards its national targets and ending AIDS, placing people at the centre of all development policies.\n\nThe stakes are high but so are the opportunities. As Deputy Prime Minister Vu Duc Dam, Chair of the National Committee has said, “Let’s us all make 100-100-100 percent commitment in order to achieve the 90-90-90 targets”, toward ending AIDS in Viet Nam by 2030!\n\nThank you very much and chuc suc khoe!"}]}

I also would like to thank KOICA for contributing funding to the project \"Building a Model to respond to Violence Against Women and Girls in Viet Nam\". The launch event of today is one of activities conducted under the framework of this project.\n\nDistinguished guests,\n\nViolence against women and girls (VAWG) remains the most pervasive and unaddressed human rights violation on earth. Situation in Viet Nam is no different. Despite the great efforts made by the Government, CSOs, International organizations and development partners in the last decade, VAWG is still a serious issue threatening the peace and security of women and girls.\n\nAlthough there has been little research conducted on the problem, available data shows that nearly one in four women worldwide experience sexual violence by an intimate partner in their lifetime, and up to one-third of adolescent girls report their first sexual experience as being forced.\n\nIn Viet Nam, a MOLISA and Action Aid survey in 2016, which was conducted in five cities and provinces found that 51 per cent of women admitted that they had experienced sexual harassment at least once.\n\nRecently, through media we have witnessed shocking attacks on women and girls such as the case of a young girl in Dien Bien who was kidnapped, raped and killed by a group of men during New Lunar Year Festival; sexual harassment of nine primary school students by a male teacher in Bac Giang province, etc...Sexual violence against women and girls is a global pandemic, most of victims are women, and the risk is higher for adolescents and young people.\n\nLadies and gentlemen,\n\nFrom 2013 up to now, UNFPA has been supporting MOCST, and then MOLISA to lead and coordinate annual national communication campaigns in response to 16 days activism on ending VAWG, and national action month on gender equality and prevention of GBV since it has been recognized by the Government in 2016.\n\nCommunication package, including logo and IEC materials of the campaigns were developed and used for several years. Recently, the International Women's Day on 8 March has been celebrated with the theme: \"Think equal, build smart, innovate for change.\n\nIn order to have one voice and image on any single activities towards the issue of GE and GBV, we need to renew the branding of the campaign in creative and innovative ways to raise public awareness and mobilize joint-actions in promotion of the fundamental right of every child and every woman to live a life free of violence.\n\nIn this context, I would like to highlight three key messages as follows:\n\nFirstly, information of the competition should be widely disseminated to draw the attention of public and mobilize the participation of different target groups, including ethnic minorities, people with disabilities, and LGBTi through various communication channels: mass media and social media...\n\nSecondly, the communication package of the campaign should be innovative for changing the mindsets and behaviors, particularly men towards gender equality; challenging traditional cultural norms and gender stereotypes, which reinforce dominant male attitudes and violent behaviors; creating an enabling and supportive environment for Vietnamese women to step up and speak out, to make perpetrators feel shame and discomfort when inflicting violence against their partners, co-workers, fellow students, women and girls in the street.\n\nThirdly, we encourage all participants of the competition to adopt green behaviours by reducing the amount of printing, recycling paper, plastic and glass and suggesting eco-friendly materials and products for the branding package.\n\nI am so happy to see that many young people gather today. Let's collaborate with us to make a real contribution to ending violence against women and girls in Viet Nam.\n\nEnding violence against women should be a priority for every man and woman.\n\nTogether, we can make Viet Nam safer and more equitable for women and girls.\n\nI thank all the distinguished guests for your attention and participation. I wish you all good health, happiness and success.\n\nXin Cam On!"}]}

Congratulations to ISDS, GBVNet, UN Women and Australian Aid. International Women’s Day is, indeed, an appropriate occasion to have such an important milestone event and I am very pleased to be the first male speaker at it, representing both the United Nations in Viet Nam here as well as the Informal Ambassadors and Heads of Agencies Gender Policy Coordination Group which I co-chair with Her Excellency the Ambassador of Mexico. With the active participation of men together with women and other genders, I have high hopes for a faster journey for Viet Nam towards achieving the gender equality goal and other related gender targets in the Sustainable Development Goals agenda by 2030; bringing greater opportunity and benefit for both women and men, girls and boys, as we collectively foster a more sustainable socio-economic development for all in Viet Nam in the future.\n\nWe know that around the world Violence Against Women and Children has been exacerbated during the COVID-19 pandemic. It is now referred to as the Shadow Pandemic. School closures and financial and food insecurity for families have heightened the risk of domestic violence for women and children, and also, of sexual exploitation and harassment in both online and offline settings.\n\nWhat is important for us to realize is that even before COVID-19 started, Violence Against Women and Children was already widespread in Viet Nam and the world.\n\nNow, I would like to especially call for the attention of all the men participating in this Forum. If you are here today, you clearly care about this topic. I urge you to take further steps after leaving this event: raise your voice when you witness any acts of discrimination and violence against women or children; lead by example showing respect for women and girls; share domestic and care work with the women in your household; join the gender equality and women’s empowerment movement if you haven’t already done so; and inspire and engage other men and boys to do all of the above.\n\nI know that many of you are already gender advocates participating in efforts to transform social norms, behavior, and gender stereotypes that perpetuate discrimination and inequality in addition to exemplifying non-violent behavior towards women and children at home and in public spaces. Remember that in your day-to-day life, you have many roles with respect to women and girls as colleagues, husbands, fathers, brothers, and friends. Your voice and active roles will be essential in promoting gender equality, especially in preventing violence against women and girls and supporting women and children survivors of violence.\n\nI hope this National Forum will create an open space to exchange our experience and practices as male advocates and as change agents and to provide momentum, more energy and inspiration which will result in shortening and accelerating the path to achieving gender equality in Viet Nam.\n\nI wish you all a very successful event! It is unfortunate that I cannot stay because of another event I have shortly but I wanted to be here personally to convey this message. This is an important historic event for Viet Nam – the first of its kind – and I certainly hope it won’t be the last.\n\nThank you. Xin Cam On."}]}

We are excited to gather today to commemorate International Women’s Day. I am honoured to be here representing the UN in Viet Nam and to open today’s policy discussion on the topic of “DigitALL: Innovation and technology for gender equality”.\n\n[We all know that] the digital revolution has tremendous potential to accelerate progress toward the Sustainable Development Goals, including on one of the most vexing challenges of our time -- gender equality.When the UN Secretary-General, Mr António Guterres, visited Viet Nam last year, he did not speak about accelerating progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals. He spoke aboutrescuingthem. We only have seven more years until 2030. We know it will require political will, solidarity and resources. And, it will also require digital and technological innovation.\n\nThis transformation will affect how we work, learn, and communicate. It disrupts status quo, opens up new opportunities and breaks down traditional barriers to women's ability to participate. It can improve the well-being, education, health and livelihoods of women and girls. It can raise women's and girls’ awareness of their rights, increase their civic engagement, and provides platforms to share their ideas.\n\nThe global theme of the International Women’s Day this year is also the priority of the 67th session of the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women (CSW).The Commission on the Status of Women is the principal global intergovernmental body exclusively dedicated to the promotion of gender equality and the empowerment of women. The CSW is instrumental in promoting women’s rights, documenting women’s day-to-day lives and shaping global standards on gender equality and the empowerment of women. This year, the CSW will convene participants from governments, the UN family, and NGOs. We meet here today to contribute to this global dialogue by discussing this theme in the context of Viet Nam.\n\nDistinguished guests,\n\nIn Viet Nam, the Government has set out on an ambitious journey.Digital transformation is needed in society and in the economy. It is considered a vehicle to increase productivity, stimulate innovation, and ensure that Viet Nam remains competitive internationally. Looking into the future, and towards Viet Nam’s ambition to become a high-income country by 2045, the digital transformation journey must include all citizens as active contributors. Gender-responsive digital transformation and innovation are vital to achieve this ambition.\n\nWe have already seen how innovation and technology have helped to improve the lives of women and girls in Viet Nam.From mobile apps that provide health-related information, to e-learning platforms that make education accessible to women and girls in remote areas, to digital platforms that empower women entrepreneurs to start and grow their businesses, we have witnessed the transformative impact of technology on gender equality.\n\nAt the same time, we must also recognize that innovation and technology risk perpetuating gender stereotypes and exacerbating existing inequalities.Women’s exclusion from the digital world has shaved $1 trillion from the gross domestic product of low- and middle-income countries in the last decade— a loss that will grow to $1.5 trillion by 2025 if no action is taken. Even though 75% of all jobs globally are expected to be in the field of science, technology, engineering or maths by 2050, in Viet Nam, women comprise only 36% of the current proportion of graduates completing tertiary education in STEM. It is not surprising that out of all the sectors in Viet Nam, the greatest gender imbalance is found in the innovation and tech industries. Technological and digital innovations will drastically cut the demand for unskilled and low-skilled labour, majority of which are women.\n\nThe digital world has also given gender-based violence new spaces to thrive.38 % of women in 51 countries have experienced online violence. In addition to threatening mental and physical well-being, discrimination and the risk of online violence may also limit women and girls’ active digital participation. Worldwide, the impunity of technology-facilitated violence remains dangerously unchecked. This includes children’s exposure to harmful and objectionable content. In Viet Nam, up to 70% of children are exposed to harmful and objectionable content. Human traffickers have also moved online. The lack of data on digital violence in Viet Nam is a critical gap. Online violence, including gender-based violence online, remains a fairly new topic of discussion. Further research and more disintegrated data are needed to better understand and address these issues.\n\nThis year’s priority theme is a call to action.\n\nWe need to urgently deepen our understanding of the gendered impacts of innovation and technology and propose concrete solutions that will allow for a more inclusive and equitable digital evolution in Viet Nam.I offer four recommendations for today’s discussions.\n\nToday’s celebration of International Women's Day asks all of us to commit to a world where innovation and technology are harnessed to create a more equitable and just society.The United Nations in Viet Nam, puts highest priority to this commitment in support of the Government and the people of Viet Nam.\n\nThank you! Xin cam on!"}]}

The UN Resident Coordinator, has, unfortunately, just left for overseas on official travel which he could not postpone and is, therefore, unable to participate in this important event.\n\nHe has asked that I convey both his warm greetings and his regrets for not being here to His Excellency the Prime Minister and all other Ministers and government representatives present here today. Allow me now to read the Resident Coordinator's message.\n\nThe UN Country Team wishes to commend the leadership of the Prime Minister and the Government of Viet Nam in placing disaster risk reduction and climate resilience at the centre of its key priorities. This is particularly important because each year disaster related losses cost more than 1% of Vietnam's GDP with this having significantly increased over the last two years because of much larger-scale disasters. Vietnam's own estimates also indicate that its cost of adapting to climate change is likely to rise to 3% of GDP by 2030.\n\nIndeed, recent disasters have highlighted how climate change-related risks can jeopardize Viet Nam's overall hard-earned development gains, in addition to intensifying existing vulnerabilities and disparities among ethnic minority communities, marginalized and poor families, as well as women, children and the elderly. Indeed, the impact of recent disasters has shown that poor households have a disproportionately higher likelihood of falling back into poverty since it is more difficult for them to recover. Disasters can thus have a cumulative life-long impact with existing inequities compounded and passed onto future generations.\n\nIn responding to these disasters, the UN Country Team in Viet Nam, together with numerous bilateral development partners such as the Government of Japan and the Republic of Korea, has provided valuable and timely support by mobilizing important and urgently needed resources, most significantly through the UN's own Central Emergency Response Fund. This has allowed for improved joint responses to implement life-saving activities in the areas of food security and the restoration of livelihoods, water and sanitation, shelter, nutrition and protection. Nevertheless, building long-term resilience remains a critical priority for the longer-term.\n\nDistinguished guests,\n\nOn this important occasion, the UN Country Team in Viet Nam would like to present three key messages on the way forward.\n\nFirst, more efforts and resources need to be channelled towards strengthening the capacities of institutions and local actors in understanding disaster risk in all its dimensions. Social protection, particularly for the most vulnerable groups, must also be designed in a manner which is more responsive and resilient to shocks, ensuring that no one is left behind in addition to enabling the country to \"Build Back Better.\"\n\nSecond, reinforcing the resilience of communities and vulnerable groups by equipping them with knowledge and life skills to prepare and cope with natural disasters, will be critical.\n\nThird, in line with Agenda 2030, the Paris Climate Change Agreement, the Addis Ababa Action Agenda on Financing for Development and the Sendai Framework, an expanded partnership between the Government and all partners, especially civil society organizations and the communities themselves will likely be the most critical element of successful implementation.\n\nYour Excellency, the Prime Minister, Ladies and Gentlemen, Allow me to conclude by saying that the United Nations Resident Coordinator in Viet Nam wanted to take this opportunity to reiterate the UN Country Team's commitment, as a longstanding partner of the Government of Viet Nam, to continuing our support to your Excellency's Government and the people of Vietnam in this complex and multidimensional area.\n\nThank You, Xin Cảm Ơn!"}]}

Today’s event demonstrates the level of international integration and globalization that the Central Youth Union and United Nations in Viet Nam have been able to achieve.\n\nBefore I deliver my speech, I wanted to ask you a few questions. There are no right or wrong answers.\n\nFirst, what do you know about the UN, in Viet Nam or generally?\n\nSecond, what are you curious to learn about the UN in Viet Nam for today’s visit?\n\nThird, how do you want to continue engaging with the UN after this visit?\n\nThank you for sharing your insights.\n\nLet’s start with some history.\n\nIt may be worthwhile looking back at Viet Nam’s dynamic, evolving and valuedmembership in the UN over the last 45 years.\n\nViet Nam officially joined the UN in September 1977, two years after the end of the war in 1975. Some agencies were already actively supporting Viet Nam prior to this.Over the past 46 years, Viet Nam has transformed from a country reliant on UN assistance, to one with increasing capacity to strongly contribute to regional and global agendas.\n\nEvery five years, the UN and the Government formulate and agree on aUN Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework. The current Cooperation Framework or CF covers the period 2022-2026, and it details what and how the UN agencies here today are committed to continue to work hand in hand with the Government to support Viet Nam to implement the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the SDGs. Specifically, we prioritize supporting the Government in:\n\nOur partnership is two-way. While we support the government and people of Viet Nam, Viet Nam is at the same time a responsible member and a strong supporter of multilateralism anchored in the United Nations.\n\nToday, Viet Nam plays an important regional and global role, including asmember of the Human Rights Council for the 2023-2025 term, a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council for the 2020-2021 term, and as the ASEAN Chair for 2020.  We at the UN highly value Viet Nam’s increasing contributions to the Organisation, including to UN peace operations.\n\nI was interested to hear if anyone would mention the SDGs.\n\nLast week was an important time for the UN. There were a number of high-level events at the UN General Assembly in New York.At the SDG Summit, Viet Nam reiterated its unwavering commitment to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, making national commitments to SDG Acceleration.Viet Nam continues to move towards its net-zero emission target by 2050, and coal phase-out by the 2040s.   Viet Nam is moving towards inclusiveness, sustainability and resilience.  But to achieve these noble goals, Viet Nam needs to make enormous amount of investment in priority areas by adopting the whole-of-government and whole-of-society approach.\n\nIn simple terms, the SDGs will not be achieved by one Ministry in the Government, it will need every single one of us to take action. We all need to participate and contribute – making our choices count.\n\nI want to see you, the youth representatives, step up to make substantive contributions to the achievement of these goals. How do you think you can contribute?\n\nThe Vietnamese government has recognized the massive potential of the youth.  For our part, the UN in Viet Nam has long remained a trusted partner of Viet Nam in addressing youth-related issues.  While many UN Agencies partner with the youth, we take a One UN approach,especially through the Thematic Group on Youth (TGY).In this way, theUN contributes to the improvements of national laws, policies and programmes on adolescents and youth development, and provide direct support to youth and youth-led organizations to strengthen this participation and ensure youth engagement in the SDG implementation.\n\nViet Nam is blessed with a vast pool of young talent – there are22.1 million individuals aged between 16 and 30.This potential needs to be seized towards the SDG attainment by 2030 and beyond, as the country is aging rapidly at the same time.\n\nThroughout every UN-led youth initiative, the young generation has co-led, co-designed and participated at the forefront. Such active engagement is crucial for national development.With the authorities investing inquality educationand fostering an enabling environment for youth engagement, the youth generation will be well equipped to play a leading role in driving a just and equitable transitions towards a sustainable future in Viet Nam.\n\nUN-led youth programs and projects can provide opportunities for theyouth to foster innovative and transformative changes that Viet Nam sorely needs. Young people contribute significantly to the outcomes of UN work through volunteering, providing unique perspectives and diverse knowledge on critical issues, from environmental protection to climate action; from quality education for all children to food security; from digital transformation to jobs and social protection.\n\nIn terms of the institutional set-up, the Ho Chi Minh Communist Youth Union and other youth organisations such as the Viet Nam Youth Federation and the Viet Nam Students Association are also as key agents of mobilization activities, such as this visit to the Green One UN House today.Youth plays a critical role in developing youth law and in implementation of programs. As you, youth representatives from such diverse backgrounds have realized, opportunities for you to engage and lead are very well presented in Viet Nam. You simply need to have the access, tools and courage to take the leap.\n\nI want to close by saying thank you: to the representatives of Central Youth Union, to my UN colleagues and most importantly, to all of you incredible young people present here today or online. Your support and commitment have played an important role in the success of our joint work.\n\nI look forward to seeing you all in many other initiatives. Perhaps at the UN Day celebrations in October. But beyond that, I am confident that many, if not all of you will become leaders of a more vibrant, inclusive and sustainable Viet Nam.\n\nThank you and wish you a very good evening!"}]}

But we also recognize that speeding up the delivery and efficiency of assistance to the more vulnerable beneficiaries is a just one element of a very complex effort.\n\nAs we unfortunately move into a future which is likely to have more frequent and intense hazard events, I welcome the efforts of all key relevant partners who have gathered here today to learn from the past and to forge a stronger partnership for the future.\n\nThe UN in Viet Nam supports Viet Nam's initiative to form a partnership between the UN, the CCNDCP, MARD, VNDMA and other development partners including the private sector under the Sendai Framework. To this end, the UN Disaster Risk Reduction for Resilience Joint Results Group has been working to support MARD's initiative of forming a partnership on DRR between the Government and development partners including the private sector. We stand behind this initiative to facilitate coordination on DRR for resilience, and to improve coherence of partners' support for DRR across different sectors and agencies, which is at the core of the Sendai Framework Targets and DRR-related SDGs.\n\nThe UN has a long-term commitment to its partnership with the Government, and we enjoy strong collaboration through the One Strategic Plan 2017-2021. Under the leadership of UNICEF and the vice-chairmanship of UNDP, the UN Joint Results Group on Disaster Risk Reduction and Resilience brings together 10 UN agencies with a wide range of global experience and networks to support the efforts of Viet Nam. In addition, as the UN Resident Coordinator, I personally lead the UN Disaster Response Management Team, both in times of preparedness and at times of crisis.\n\nLadies and Gentlemen,\n\nI commend the commitment of Viet Nam to bring Disaster Risk Reduction to the heart of the national development agenda, as it gives due attention to a long-term and sustainable approach to addressing existing vulnerabilities. The shift in strategy from emergency response to disaster risk reduction, management and preparedness is taking place at the level of the country's top leadership and as a result, we are witnessing that shift at the local level as a key future priority.\n\nAn integral step in implementing the Sendai Framework are the national legal structures that support Disaster Risk Reduction and I would like to take this opportunity to commend the effort of the Government of Viet Nam in amending the Law on Natural Disaster Prevention and Control and recognize the enormous potential in this revision which allows us to take great strides toward strengthening disaster risk governance systems.\n\nThere are several areas where changes to the legal structure can have a particular impact and I would like to highlight some of these and extend an offer on behalf of the UN to support these efforts in any way we can. For example, Viet Nam has a long history in strengthening people-centered systems and approaches, as enshrined in the 2013 Constitution. The amendment of the Law on NDPC can help further ensure that the people are a central part of the system and are not only regularly updated with actionable information and are beneficiaries of support, but also play an active role in effective disaster risk management, preparedness, and humanitarian response.\n\nMajor natural disasters in recent years have highlighted that the most vulnerable people bear the brunt of the immediate and long-term impacts because natural disasters exacerbate existing vulnerabilities and disparities such as poverty, high incidence of severe acute malnutrition, poor hygiene and sanitation conditions as well as poor caring practices. The case of flash floods caused by a construction site in Phuoc Dong commune, Nha Trang City, Khanh Hoa province in late 2018 is a tragic example, where we witnessed flashfloods that resulted in the deaths of 10 people.\n\nThe revised law is an opportunity to mandate relevant actors to identify and address the root causes and drivers of risks experienced in communities, including vulnerabilities due to age, economic status, gender, ethnic minority and migrant status.\n\nThe planned revision is an opportunity for Viet Nam to ensure that the law strengthens risk-informed approaches in national, sectoral and provincial Social-Economic Development Plans, so that Disaster risk reduction, preparedness and recovery in the context of Viet Nam is most strategically positioned within the long-term sustainable development agenda.\n\nI would also highlight that women are often under-represented in all levels of the disaster risk management and response mechanisms of Viet Nam. There is a lack of capacity building for local staff on how to support vulnerable groups, especially women including poor, single-headed households, and those with family members and children with disabilities, and this law revision has the potential to further incorporate gender issues across all aspects of the law, ensuring in particular that women are well represented in the VDMA system and that their views are reflected in decision making at all levels.\n\nFinally, the UN in Viet Nam would like to recognize the opportunity for the new law to ensure that the new provisions are aligned with international treaties and frameworks that Viet Nam has signed and ratified or is party to, such as the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, international humanitarian laws, the SDGs and the Sendai Framework. Viet Nam's domestic legislation needs to be aligned with these international obligations as soon as possible if it isn't already. The new law should also be aligned with relevant recent national legislation, such as the Law on Children in order to support consistent enforcement.\n\nOn behalf of the UN, I would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to cooperating closely with the Government of Viet Nam and other stakeholders to accelerate progress towards achieving the SDGs through the implementation of the Disaster Risk Reduction partnership, and I offer our full support toward the revision of the Law on Natural Disasters.\n\nThe challenges ahead are formidable. And there is no time to lose. I am encouraged by your presence here today and particularly wish to acknowledge the contributions of the key ministries and governmental organs who are working on related matters from MARD, VDMA, CCNDPC as well as the Private Sector. I am proud and happy to conclude by reiterating that the UN in Viet Nam will remain a committed partner in supporting Viet Nam to put in place leading edge disaster risk planning, implementation, monitoring and evaluation institutions and systems.\n\nThank you! Xin Cảm Ơn!"}]}

Honorable Helen Clark, previous Prime Minister of New Zealand, previous UNDP Administrator and previous Chair of the United Nations Development Group;\n\nExcellency, Ambassador Wendy Matthews, Ambassador of New Zealand in Viet Nam;\n\nUN and UNDP colleagues;\n\nDistinguished Guests,\n\nI am delighted to welcome Helen Clark. She is my former boss and someone I admire. I interacted with her closely over 8 years both on global and regional issues and in many different country contexts – Malaysia, Singapore, Turkey, Syria and even Viet Nam briefly. So, it is a special privilege and pleasure for me to welcome her here today to the UN's ecological and otherwise front runner ONE UN House in the world. Helen Clark has worked throughout her career tirelessly to promote gender equality and empowerment of women and she has paved the way for women to step up and lead. I would like to thank her and all of you for joining this event today which is aimed at promoting women's empowerment and leadership.\n\nWhile the main reason for advancing both women's and gender causes should be rights-based, there are good economic reasons for doing this as well. A recent report by McKinsey Global Institute highlighted that \"by advancing women's equality, the economies of Asia Pacific could boost their collective GDP by 4.5 trillion a year by 2025*. Through its endorsement of the SDGs, Viet Nam has committed to achieving Gender Equality and Empowering all Women and Girls by 2030. Viet Nam has a strong track record of promoting gender equality and women's empowerment. Last month, UNDP shared in-depth analysis on the latest statistical data from the Human Development Indices and Indicators and Viet Nam ranks 67 out of 160 countries.\n\nHowever, both as UN Resident Coordinator and as the Co-Chair of the Informal Gender Ambassadors and Heads of Agencies Group, I am all too aware that the current situation is still far from where Viet Nam has stated its wishes to be and should be, given its aspiration and the historic role of women in the liberation movement. The current review of the Labour Code provides an excellent opportunity to address some of these issues as both the UN and our Informal Gender Ambassadors & Heads of Agencies Group continues to do. Numerous challenges remain including discriminatory practices in hiring and promotion, women being seen as unfit for jobs in certain occupations and for leadership positions in many professions and the substantive pay gap which exists between men and women for similar work. Viet Nam is also one of the few countries with a significant difference in the age of retirement for women and men in government jobs where we see many women being forced to retire at the age of 55 while men retire at 60. While this is hopefully about to change, and the gap is likely to reduce, there should be no gap at all. These stereotypes and norms create unequal power relations between men and women that normalize and condone men's dominance in leadership positions. We therefore encourage Vietnam to pursue efforts to further strengthen the empowerment of women and work towards the achievement of gender equality, using the revised Labour Code in 2019 as one major instrument to address gender inequalities.\n\nAs part of UNDP's continuous work supporting women empowerment and leadership in Viet Nam, UNDP Viet Nam launched in 2016 a nation-wide and youth-oriented campaign called #How Abnormal, which aimed at putting a spotlight on prevalent discriminatory gender stereotypes in Vietnam. It was a great success and was well appreciated by many educational institutions, development agencies and students across Viet Nam. As part of the campaign, many Festival days were organized in the 13 largest universities, featuring student drama performances on breaking gender stereotypes and talk shows with champions of gender equality. The events were very successful and all together 30,000 students joined these events and 15,000 people signed the on-line pledge forms to commit to breaking negative gender stereotypes. There was also a photo exhibition \"Women can do\", which you are seeing here today.\n\nInspired by the success of the first campaign, a second stage was launched. The main objective shifted to promoting the proactive role of youth in breaking gender stereotypes in occupational choices and promoting the concept of transformational and influential leadership among youth in contributing to community development in Viet Nam. At the heart of both campaigns has been a film competition that supports young groups of film makers to present touching and fresh ways of breaking gender stereotypes. UNDP has also implemented several other projects promoting gender equality and women's empowerment such as providing leadership training for women leaders and cadres at community level.\n\nUnless we reduce inequalities between men and women, the latter will continue to face more discrimination and less opportunities in this country, regionally and globally. So today we are here to listen to young women leaders speak about their stories working on the ground to overcome gender stereotypes and unleash the full potential of women in Viet Nam. I believe all the participants here, whether working or still studying in universities, have been active agents of change. Together, we need to keep working towards creating a more equal and inclusive society to finally bridge the gender gap.\n\nWe look forward to hearing from our young Vietnamese women leaders and from Helen Clark about her truly inspiring journey breaking many glass ceilings along the way as multiple-time Prime Minister of New Zealand between 1999 and 2008 and two time UNDP Administrator between 2009 and 2017 when she was also Chair of the United Nations Development Group.\n\nI thank you very much for your attention this morning. Please enjoy the event and the discussion.\n\nThank you!

Thank you for your time and engagement in today’s event. Our dialogue is in preparation for theSustainable Development Goals Summitto be held at the UN General Assembly on 18 – 19 September 2023. The SDG Summit is an opportunity to secure the breakthroughs and momentum needed to change course and achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030.\n\nWhy are we here?\n\nThe first sentence in the special report of the UN Secretary General, “Progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals: towards a rescue plan for people and planet” provides the most meaningful answer, “a promise in peril.”\n\n“Leave no one behind” is the defining principle of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. It is a shared promise by every country to work together to secure the rights and well-being of everyone on a healthy, thriving planet. But halfway to 2030, that promise is in peril. The Sustainable Development Goals are disappearing in the rear-view mirror, as are the hope and rights of current and future generations. A fundamental shift is needed – in commitment, solidarity, financing and action – to put the world on a better path. And it is needed now.\n\nWe can do better, and in moments of severe challenges, humanity has always come through. Now is another of those moments. The SDG Summit must signal a genuine turning point. It must mobilize the political commitment and breakthroughs our world desperately needs. It must deliver a rescue plan for people and planet.\n\nRescue the SDGs.\n\nI recall that in the early discussions to prepare for Viet Nam’s 2nd VNR, I already echoed the UN Secretary General’s call for world leaders to help deliver a‘Rescue Plan for People and Planet’--- including by announcing national and global commitments that will help drive SDG transformation for inclusion and sustainability in the years ahead.\n\nViet Nam’s high-level participation and presentation of ambitious National Commitments to accelerate SDGs by 2030 is a testament to the country’s unwavering support to multilateralism anchored in the United Nations, and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the SDGs.\n\nThe UN joins hands with the Ministry of Planning and Investment (MPI) and GIZ in organizing this dialogue to facilitate sharing of innovative ideas and recommendations in the formulation of Viet Nam’s National Commitments to SDG Transformation. These Commitments will help provide concrete pathways for the Government of Viet Nam and various stakeholders to rescue the SDGs. This dialogue, more importantly, allows us to demonstrate our solidarity and support implementation.\n\nHow are we doing globally and nationally on the SDGs?\n\nAt the mid-way point of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the SDGs globally are severely off-track. The multiple crises of the last three years have dealt a major blow to the SDGs. In the UN Secretary-General’s special report, we learn that just 12 percent of the assessable SDG targets are on track. Hence the urgent need to change course and to secure the breakthroughs is needed to achieve the goals by 2030.\n\nViet Nam is no exception. The VNR report that we launch today shows that Viet Nam has made considerable progress in various goals. However, Viet Nam still needs to boost implementation and investments to bring all SDGs back on track to achieve the 2030 targets. We have less than seven years left.\n\nOpportunities for transformation\n\nBut we can turn things around. Although the overall picture is deeply concerning, the data also offers a glimpse of the possible. It shows progress in several key areas from energy to Internet access and more. There is also ample evidence that the transformation demanded by the SDGs is one of immense opportunity.\n\nThe SDGs remain a truly inspiring and unifying compass. Our generation is equipped with knowledge, technologies and resources unprecedented in history and can draw on a wide range of normative frameworks. Breaking through to a better future for all demands that we put this advantage to use to lift people out of poverty, advance gender equality, put our world on low-emissions pathways by 2030 and secure human rights for all.\n\nIn Viet Nam, the UN believes that challenges can be turned into opportunities --- to transform the country’s socio-economic development model --- to be more sustainable, inclusive and resilient, where no one is left behind.\n\nViet Nam’s priorities for SDG acceleration\n\nAt the High-Level Political Forum (HLPF) in New York last July, H.E. Minister of Planning and Investments outlined six priorities to accelerate SDG implementation in the remaining period:\n\nFirst, place people at the center of every decision, policy, and action.\n\nSecond, prioritize Science, Technology, and Innovation as a decisive lever for successful SDG implementation.\n\nThird, improve the quality of human resources through development of equal, inclusive, and comprehensive educational and vocational training system.\n\nFourth,strengthen the management and efficient use of resources, environmental protection, climate change adaptation and mitigation, natural disaster prevention and mitigation, and development of green and circular economy.\n\nFifth,mobilize and effectively use financial resources including international and domestic public and private sources.\n\nSixth,continue the improvement of data availability including aggregated and disaggregated data to effectively monitor and assess the implementation of the SDGs.\n\nViet Nam’s priorities identified in the VNR are well aligned with the 12 High Impact Initiatives (HIIs) developed by the UN globally to drive SDG transformation. There are 6 transitions, 5 accelerators and 1 cross cutting initiative.\n\nThe six transitions are in Social Protection and Jobs, Energy Compacts, Transforming Education, Food Systems, Digital Transformation, and Biodiversity and Nature Protection. Gender equality is cross-cutting, while the remaining 5 are means of implementation: finance, data, SDG localization, trade and public sector capabilities. The six transitions can generate large multiplier effects across SDGs to promote economic prosperity, while protecting human and environmental wellbeing.\n\nViet Nam has set ambitious targets, committed and initiated action in all six transitions, among others through the Just Energy Transition Partnership (JETP), the National Action Plan on Food Systems Transformation, the Education Development Strategic Plan 2021-2030, National Digital Transformation Programme by 2025 with an orientation to 2030, and Party Resolution on Social Policy.\n\nBuilding upon these existing national commitments,the central questions are:\n\nWhat and how transitions need to be prioritized in Viet Nam? What supporting policies, institutional arrangements, processes and actions are required to deliver these transitions and achieve SDG transformations? How to enhance coordination, integration and synergies in implementation across priority actions?How to strengthen partnerships and collaboration across diverse sectors and stakeholders? How to ensure that the transitions are just, equitable and inclusive?\n\nDespite the potential merits, the transitions without adequate engagement across sectors and stakeholders could create winners and losers – widening inequalities and vulnerabilities in society and derailing SDG progress. Ensuring that transitions are just, equitable and inclusive underpin the promise of leaving no one behind.  Our Secretary-General has called for a whole-of-government and whole-of-society approach.  The UN stands ready to partner with all segments of the society towards SDG attainment.\n\nFinally, we know that the SDGs can only be reached with equal commitment and focus on the means of implementation.Priority transitions for SDG breakthroughs require adequate and effective financing.\n\nViet Nam identified “financing” in its VNR as an enabler of transitions and policies into actions and results. An “SDG Financing Strategy” is key. While mobilizing additional financial resources is a priority, unlocking existing resources, including official development assistance (ODA) and enhancing domestic resource efficiency is equally important. Moreover, aligning the financial resources such as the state budget with SDG targets strengthens implementation and tracking of investments and progress.\n\nIt is timely that we hold this SDG dialogue on the eve of Viet Nam’s National Day celebrations. It is a meaningful occasion to reflect on Viet Nam’s remarkable socio-economic development journey and what remains to be done to achieve its ambition of becoming a high-income country by 2045.  As long-standing partners of the Government and the people of Viet Nam, on behalf of the UN Country Team, I reaffirm our commitment to support Viet Nam in its journey to achieve inclusive and sustainable development.\n\nThank you! Xin cam on!"}]}

Tong Thi Phong, Member of Polit Bureau, Vice Chair Woman of National Assembly;\n\nExcellency Mr. Nguyen Huu Dong, Party Secretary of Son La Provincial Party Committee;\n\nExcellency Mme. Nguyen Thuy Anh, Chairwoman of Committee for Social Affairs;\n\nExcellency Mr. Nguyen Chi Dung, Minister of Ministry of Planning and Investment;\n\nExcellency Mr. Nguyen Xuan Cuong, Minister of Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development;\n\nExcellency Mr. Do Van Chien, Minister, Chairman of Committee for Ethnic Minority Affairs\n\nRepresentatives of other line ministries and local governments,\n\nDistinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,\n\nI am honored and delighted to be here in Moc Chau, a district town of Son La province surrounded by beautiful green tea hills and natural landscapes and to participate in this workshop representing Mr. Kamal Malhotra, the UN Resident Coordinator in Viet Nam. He very much has wished to be here and regrets that he was unable to join in this important occasion.\n\nOn behalf of the Resident Coordinator and in my capacity as Co-Chair of the Ethnic Minority Working Group, I would like to congratulate the National Assembly’s Committee for Social Affairs, the Committee on Ethnic Minority Affairs, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, Son La Provincial Party Committee, and Viet Nam Cooperative Alliance and all participants for organizing this workshop on human resource development for ethnic minority and mountainous areas in agriculture, rural development and sustainable poverty reduction.\n\nIn March 2019, Mme. Phong extended invitation to the UN representatives to visit Son La on a field trip. Our RC described the visit as, which I quote, “an eye-opening experience that allowed me to better understand and gain first-hand experience on the dynamic and beautiful cultural diversity in Viet Nam.”\n\nThe topics of today’s workshop remain highly important priorities in Viet Nam’s development agenda. We must continue our earnest effort to accelerate socio-economic development and poverty reduction, especially in ethnic minority areas, towards the SDG achievement in Viet Nam, while leaving no one behind. In fact, the SDGs in Vietnam cannot be achieved without prioritizing such an acceleration.\n\nOver the past decades, Viet Nam’s success in socio-economic development had been recognized by the international community, especially its impressive results in poverty reduction and the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. Extreme poverty fell sharply from 49.2% (1992) to 0.7% (2018) over 15 years. The 2019 Multidimensional Poverty Report jointly launched by UNDP and MOLISA shows multi-dimensional poverty rate (defined by Viet Nam’s national MDP measurements) reduced significantly from 8.23% in 2016 to 3.72% in 2019, lifting around 6.5 million people out of multi-dimensional deprivation.\n\nDespite this success in terms of the national average, we also know that similar socio-economic development had been slow, and poverty still remains much too prevalent in the mountainous and ethnic minority areas. The people in these areas were faced with multiple challenges even before the new complications brought about by COVID-19, which has potentially disproportionate socio-economic impacts on vulnerable groups. Even prior to January 2020, such peoples were heavily impacted by climate change, environmental and natural disasters which directly affected their livelihoods. Women and girls in many ethnic minority areas often faced limitations in accessing healthcare services, participating in decision-making processes, and continuing education. The reasons for this range from persistent social norms of the roles of men and women, to the male-centered ideology, even though in some ethnic minority areas there is a matriarchal society which makes lives of women easier than in patriarchal societies. Insufficient gender-responsive budgeting also hinders the development of gender statistics to formulate evidence-based gender-inclusive policies and interventions.\n\nThe strict physical distancing during COVID-19 has exacerbated socio-economic burdens with respect to job security and sustainable income for many vulnerable ethic minority peoples. Many of them have either lost or been confronted with reduced income and jobs. The recent assessment by UNDP and UN Women on the socio-economic impact of COVID-19 on vulnerable households and enterprises estimates that the average incomes of ethnic minority households dropped by 75% in April 2020 compared with the end of 2019. Additional statistical investigations also found that poverty rates among ethnic minority households may have increased by approximately 50 percentage points in April and May 2020, when economic activity all but ceased as a result of physical distancing measures.\n\nThe UN in Viet Nam is working closely with the government and the people of Viet Nam on COVID-19 response. We acknowledge that it is crucial to provide relevant and targeted support to the ethnic minority people including families, women and children, who make up 14.7% of Viet Nam’s population but account for a wholly disproportionate percentage of the country’s extreme poor.\n\n2020 coincidentally marks both the 75th anniversary of Vietnam’s independence as well as the 75th anniversary of the founding of the United Nations. The UN Secretary General’s priority in celebrating UN75 is to put people at the center and to earnestly listen to their concerns about and aspirations for the future and UN.  As you may know, one of the key principles of Agenda 2030 and the Sustainable Development Goals is “Leaving No One Behind”. We would like to seize this momentum to listen directly to the voices of vulnerable groups, including ethnic minority peoples. While we commend the National Assembly and the Government of Viet Nam for this initiative, the UN in Viet Nam would also like to see and contribute to many more innovative and integrated people-centered approaches and solutions from the Government. We also believe that there is an urgent need for many more platforms and incentives for ordinary people, especially the most vulnerable, so as to enable their voices to be heard and heeded.\n\nAs the United Nations begins to prepare its new UN Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework for 2022-2026, the challenges of multi-dimensional poverty eradication, especially in the ethnic minority areas, will be at the center stage for us. Indeed, the United Nations stands ready to continue its partnership with the National Assembly of Viet Nam with a view to listening to the people and shaping a better future for every Vietnamese.\n\nAllow me to conclude by once again congratulating the National Assembly of Viet Nam, the Committee on Ethnic Minority Affairs, the province of Son La as well as other Government’s agencies for jointly organizing this useful and timely workshop on human resource development. We, as a One UN in Viet Nam, will work with the National Assembly, Government agencies, ethnic minority peoples and their communities as well as other partners in this essential and important initiative. I wish you all a successful and fruitful discussion and look forward to hearing about the tangible results of the workshop from the UNDP Resident Representative, Caitlin Wiesen-Antin, when she returns. Given that we are still in COVID-19 times globally, even though Viet Nam appears to have once again contained the pandemic for now, please also let me say to each one of you and your families: stay safe; stay healthy.\n\nThank you. XinCảmƠn!"}]}

Let me at the outset thank the Viet Nam National Committee on Ageing, for co-hosting and co-organizing today's workshop to share key findings from a new report \"Towards a comprehensive national policy for an ageing in Viet Nam\". This report, a joint publication between the Viet Nam National Committee on Ageing and UNFPA in Viet Nam, analyzes population ageing in Viet Nam and its impacts and provides policy suggestions necessary for responding to this demographic trend.\n\nLadies and gentlemen,\n\nWe are all getting older. This is a fact of life.\n\nOne in nine persons is aged 60 or older. This is projected to increase to one in five by 2050.\n\nBetween 2015 and 2030, the target date for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, the number of older persons worldwide is set to increase by 56 per cent—from 901 million to more than 1.4 billion. By 2030, the number of people aged 60 and above will exceed that of people aged 15 to 24.\n\nIn Viet Nam, the proportion of older persons in the total population has increased to 11.9 per cent in 2017, and will be doubled to almost 20 per cent by 2035.\n\nAs all of you know, the 2019 Census on Population and Ageing will be launched next week on 1 April 2019 and I hope we will have the most updated number of older persons by end of this year.\n\nAs the world sets out an inspirational new development agenda, and commits to reaching the new Sustainable Development Goals, Viet Nam must envision a new paradigm that aligns demographic ageing with economic and social growth and protects the human rights of older persons.\n\nAgeing is a triumph of development. We must now turn our focus from merely helping people reach old age to helping them reach a happy old age.\n\nDistinguished guests,\n\nRapid population ageing has increasing impacts on socio-economic development and affect all population groups, which require relevant policy responses. The increasing of both percentage and absolute numbers of older persons require significant re-structuring of the society from all aspects, such as financial investment, public spending, urban and rural planning, etc...\n\nAs people age, there is increasing risk of social exclusion faced by older persons, which means being denied full access to various opportunities and resources that are normally available to the population: access to adequate employment, income, health care and housing and opportunities to participate equally with in social, political and community activities. This could lead to failure in achieving the SDGs and the aim of \"Leaving no one behind\".\n\nFurther, while the concern is mainly the older population, ageing is not only about older persons, it starts to affect everyone. For example, issues faced by young people as a result of increasing population of the older persons have to be addressed as well, for example: working women having elderly to take care of at home should be given some leave and concessions to be able to do that. Therefore, responding to population ageing doesn't mean addressing the expectation and needs of older population only, but it will require a more comprehensive approach to address the need of all population groups in preparing to an aged future.\n\nLadies and gentlemen,\n\nThe report we launch today analyzes population ageing in Viet Nam and its impacts. It also suggests policy to respond to that demographic trend. There are several sections focusing on:\n\nIt is great that my colleague from UNFPA APRO, Mr. Rintaro Monri will have a presentation on life-cycle approach and international experience in responding to population ageing.\n\nDistinguished guests,\n\nAs we step towards the better future we all want, 'leaving no one behind' will mean making space for the contributions of older persons. Let us promote the rights and ensure the full participation of older persons to build better societies for all ages.\n\nI believe that by joining forces and working together, we truly can make a difference and help promote meaningful responses to population ageing – responses based on values of non-discrimination and equality that advance the vision of a vigorous, happy and healthy old age.\n\nIt has been a genuine pleasure to witness the close collaboration between MOLISA and UNFPA over the past years. I would also like to thank again the Viet Nam National Committee on Ageing for its superb collaboration – and to thank all of you for committing your time to come and discuss at this event, which will have an impact on the well-being and happiness of elders in Viet Nam for years to come.\n\nXin cam on."}]}

I wish to especially thank our guest of honour, His Excellency Mr. Pham Binh Minh, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister, and Ambassador Mme. Nguyen Nguyet Nga, Senior Advisor to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, for their presence.\n\nExcellency, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister, please accept the UN’s sincerest condolences on the tragic loss of lives including those of soldiers rescuing people affected by the torrential downpours, floods and landslides resulting from tropical storms in the Central Provinces of Viet Nam. We also remain very concerned about those still missing. Please rest assured that the UN in Viet Nam which has been part of the joint assessment team which returned today will provide our full support in a swift and well coordinated One UN modality.\n\nExcellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,\n\nAt the outset, I wish to congratulate Viet Nam on two major accomplishments, one which we share: our common 75th Anniversary. Indeed, it is a happy coincidence that the UN turned 75 in the same year that Viet Nam is celebrating its 75th anniversary of independence. I would also like to congratulate both the Government and people of Viet Nam on containing the health-related aspects of COVID-19 through their early, effective, robust, transparent, whole-of-society and low-cost measures which have allowed us all to be here, face-to-face, today. Viet Nam is not out of the woods on COVID-19, however, since we must both guard against another wave and address many of the socio-economic challenges resulting from COVID-19, some of which are global and regional in nature.\n\nThe UN in Viet Nam has recently, just a few weeks ago, published a ‘UN Assessment of the Social and Economic Impact of COVID-19 in Viet Nam’. Copies of this and our earlier April publication onthe economic impact of COVID-19 in Viet Namare available just outside this ballroom.\n\nI would be remiss on such an occasion if I did not briefly recount some of the UN’s major accomplishments in its first 75 years, measured against its three key pillars: peace and security, development and human rights.\n\nThe UN was established, first and foremost, to prevent a third world war. Despite the numerous challenges of the long Cold War and multiple tensions and conflicts in the three decades since it ended, the United Nations has, indeed, been successful in preventing a third world war.\n\nA second task was decolonization. When the UN was founded in 1945, around 750 million people, equaling nearly one third of the world’s population at that time, lived in territories that were not self-governing. As a result, only 50 States were represented in San Francisco at the signing of the UN Charter in June 1945. The UN now has 193 Member States, and it is a clear sign of the UN’s success that its Trusteeship Council has now been dormant for many years.\n\nOn its contribution to development, let the data speak for itself. While many Governments and other development partners must share the credit, none of the huge improvement in people’s lives which has taken place since the end of the Second World War would have been possible without the work of numerous UN Agencies over the last many decades. While, globally, the number of people living in extreme poverty is now less than 10%, this figure was nearly 75% of the world’s population in 1945. Smallpox was declared eradicated in 1980 by the WHO, while as a result of the work of UNICEF and others, essential vaccine coverage is more than 80% today compared to less than 20% in 1980. The mortality rate of children under five years of age has dropped by 59% since just 1990, while primary school completion rates reached 84% in 2018 compared to 70% in 2000, primarily as a result of the UN led Millennium Development Goals. And until COVID-19 struck in 2020, Human Development, as measured by the Human Development Index, had increased every year from 1990 when the Human Development Report was first published by UNDP. As the UN Secretary-General has repeatedly stated after COVID-19 struck, achievement of the UN led Sustainable Development Goals by 2030 is the world’s best chance of building- forward- better after COVID-19.\n\nThe Universal Declaration of Human Rights, a landmark document unprecedented in world history, was adopted by the UN General Assembly in 1948, laying out a universal, common standard for all peoples and nations. Many key aspects of both the Universal Declaration and the UN’s nine core human rights Conventions have now been incorporated into the domestic legislation of most, if not all, UN Member States around the world, something unthinkable 75 years ago.\n\nThese are only a few of many notable examples which should remind us of the essential roles that the United Nations has played for the past 75 years and continues to play in these challenging times. The UN continues to make a difference, especially for the most vulnerable, seeking to leave no one behind and giving voice to those deprived of it.\n\nAt the UN, we are grateful that the World Food Programme was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize this year. It was the 12th Nobel Peace Prize awarded either to the UN as a whole or to one of its Agencies or bodies, or to a UN Secretary-General or staff member. Five of these have been awarded in the last 20 years since the 21st Century began, a remarkable 25% of the total of such awards during this period. I believe that all these twelve awards, including the most recent one in our 75th Anniversary year, recognize and reaffirm the continuing relevance and centrality of multilateralism and the UN, both of which are essential for good global governance. Indeed, in a tragic way, COVID-19 has vividly illustrated more clearly than any other episode since the 2nd World War why multilateralism, international cooperation and international solidarity, anchored in the UN system remain essential, not an option or luxury.\n\nHowever, the UN, like any other organization, needs to be fit for purpose in the 21st century. This is why our current Secretary-General embarked on wide-ranging reforms soon after he took office in 2017. Viet Nam has been at the global forefront of UN Reform at the country level for over a decade now and I am confident that it will remain so in the current ongoing phase of UN Reform. However, no global UN reform will be successful without UN Member States more seriously committing themselves to multilateralism and international cooperation and viewing these as being in their national self-interest—as Viet Nam clearly has done—in addition to reforming themselves simultaneously. To achieve this, many UN Member States will need to rise above the narrow nationalisms and populisms which are on display today. On this UN Day, I also challenge each one of you to reflect on your individual roles, capacities, and influence and on how you can use these to achieve the future you want for the world, your children and grandchildren.\n\nThis year, Secretary-General Guterres embarked on the UN75 campaign, which is the biggest global listening exercise in world history. The UN, in 2020, has listened to millions of people in all walks of life in far corners of the world, to understand their needs and hopes, conveyed in words but also in photographs and other visual forms. The photographs exhibited in the passage outside this ballroom represent the most outstanding of the 1,000 or so entries we received in the UN75 Photo Contest titled, “The Future I Want.” Please take a moment to view and enjoy them.\n\nExcellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,\n\nWe are living in extremely challenging times. Let us remind ourselves that the decisions we make today will significantly impact the future we want. The UN and its Member States must make the right decisions for succeeding generations. Let me conclude by quoting from the Secretary-General’s UN Day statement this week commemorating our 75th Anniversary:“The United Nations not only stands with you, but it belongs to you and is you. Together, let us uphold the enduring values of the United Nations Charter.”\n\nI thank you for listening. Xin Cam on."}]}

The Universal Periodic Review (UPR) is a unique process to regularly examine human rights records of all 193 UN Member States. It is a significant innovation of the Human Rights Council based on equal treatment for all countries. The UPR provides an opportunity for all States to declare what actions they have taken to improve the human rights situations in their countries and to overcome challenges to the enjoyment of human rights. Sharing of best human rights practices around the globe is embedded in the UPR. Currently, no other mechanism of this kind exists.\n\nFor creating the space to learn from each other, I thank the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and UNDP for co-organizing this event and to the Embassy of Norway for their generous support.\n\nIn the spirit of learning from each other, I take this opportunity to link the UPR with “rescuing” the SDGs.\n\nHow? [First point.] While the UPR is a state driven process, the crucial role of civil society in the mechanism is expressly recognised by theUNand its Member States and is highlighted in the resolution that establish the UPR. Since the UPR was introduced in 2007, civil society and NGOs have constantly engaged in the process: to achieve positive change for human rights across the world; and to support Governments in implementing the UPR recommendations.\n\nWe gather here today to learn more about the drafting of the National Report and the Stakeholders’ Submissions for the 4th Cycle of the UPR forViet Nam, and to share experiences of NGOs, international representatives, and other stakeholders on participating in the UPR process. Ensuring meaningful and unhindered participation, free from intimidation and reprisals, of a broad range of civil society representatives in all stages of the UPR remains crucial to ensure fulfilment of human rights for all.\n\nIn the 3rd Cycle of theUPR,Viet Namfully supported 220 out of 291 recommendations it received, an increase of 13% from the 2nd Cycle. Also worth noting is the increased participation of non-state actors with over 70 organizations contributing stakeholders' submissions, as compared with the 2nd UPR cycle. This positive trend encourages continued meaningful stakeholder participation in the 4th Cycle, starting with the 1st Consultation of the National Report, tentatively scheduled forJune2023.\n\nBeyond acceptance of recommendations, implementation will be equally important, and to do so in complementarity with other international human rights mechanisms such as Treaty Bodies and Special Procedures. Similarly, quality of the stakeholders’ report matter more than the number of submissions.\n\n[Second point] The implementation of UPR recommendations supports the achievement of the 2030 Agenda, and in turn SDG progress contributes to fulfilment of human rights. In Vietnam, when UPR recommendations are mapped against the SDGs, we see that 39% relate to SDG16 (peace, justice and institutions), 14% to SDG 1 (poverty), 9% to SDG 10 (inequality), 8% to SDG 4 (education), and 7% to SDG 17 (partnerships).\n\nViet Namis also conducting its 2nd Voluntary National Review (VNR) of SDG progress this year, and gaps have been identified in the SDG implementation including lack of data to measure progress.Viet Namis not an exception – globally, many Member States are off track to achieve the SDGs, and there is a strong and urgent call from the UN Secretary General to ‘rescue’ SDGs.\n\nTo 'rescue' the SDGs, it is imperative to strengthen the alignment between the UPR recommendations, the 2030 Agenda and key national frameworks and other relevant policies. With 39% of UPR recommendations related to SDG 16, ensuring a safe and inclusive civic space as a precondition unlocks the full potential of a whole-of-society approach.\n\nThe Secretary-General’s report on ‘Our Common Agenda’ described human rights as a“problem-solving tool for contemporary development challenges”.In this connection, the UPR can be a problem-solving tool.  I also believe that there is a pressing need to incorporate innovation and foresight in our work going forward, especially towards ‘problem-solving’.\n\nOur joint efforts are particularly important this year, as 2023 marks the 75th anniversary of the Universal Declaration on Human Rights (UDHR). In line with the Secretary-General’s ‘Highest Aspiration: A Call to Action for Human Rights’,today, we must continue to reaffirm the promise of the UDHR – ‘to uphold universal, indivisible and inalienable rights and fundamental freedoms for everyone, everywhere.’\n\nThe UN has launchedHuman Rights 75 Initiative, with many events and activities taking place in the course of the year to raise awareness about the UDHR and to reflect on achievements, best practices, and challenges with regard to the full realization of human rights for all, without discrimination of any kind. The initiative will culminate in a high-level event in December 2023 in commemoration of the 75th Anniversary.\n\nAt the Human Rights Council, Vietnam played an important role last month in sponsoring the resolution on the ‘Commemoration of the 75th anniversary of the UDHR’.  I look forward to close engagement with the Government and people ofViet Namin the implementation of this and other resolutions of the HRC.\n\nI will close with great appreciation that in this room we gather many different voices of Viet Nam’s society – from Government agencies and academia to NGOs and international partners.  I look forward to learning from all of you in our common aspiration of  building a more equal and inclusive society for all.Thank you!

Your unwavering dedication and commitment throughout the year have ensured the well-being of people during emergencies and improved their ability to recover from emergencies.\n\nToday’s end-of-year meeting  is both a time for reflection and also a moment to renew our commitment. All of us  share a common goal of building resilience and safeguarding the well-being of communities in the face of natural disasters.\n\nTo kick off our reflections, I share the story of Mrs. Tran Thi Tinh, a 73-year-old resident of Phong Binh commune in Thua Thien Hue Province. Her livelihood is anchored in fishing and a small plot of cultivated land. A few weeks ago, heavy rain caused the Bo and Huong rivers to overflow, and flood levels were highest recorded in more than a decade. Several people perished, more than 17,000 houses were flooded, 85% of commune roads in the 36 affected communes were inundated, and a large number of livestock and agricultural areas have been destroyed.\n\nMrs. Tinh’s house was submerged in 1.5 meters underwater during this flood. Forced to navigate floodwaters on a small boat, with only a few instant noodles for sustenance, she faced the incredible challenge of tending to her paralyzed husband and ensuring the safety of her nephew.\n\nIn the meantime, the complex machinery of disaster response with all its bits and pieces in the country was running. Within a  24-hour timeframe, the Anticipatory Action Protocol was activated when the trigger point of forecast rainfall was expected to exceed 500mm. As a result, 731 households comprising 1,557 people, 65% of whom are women, in 7 communes of Thua Thien Hue province, including Mrs. Tinh, received timely cash assistance. This was possible because of  the pre-agreed coordination mechanisms between VDDMA, the Provincial Committee for Natural Disaster Prevention and Control (PCNDPC), local authorities, the Red Cross and the UN, to name a few.\n\nTimely assistance provided through the anticipatory action project became the silver lining for Mrs. Tran Thi Tinh and her family. The project's cash assistance not only addressed their immediate needs of food and medicine, but also sowed the seeds of recovery and restored a sense of normalcy in the midst of chaos.\n\nThe activation of the early response measures during the flood in Thua Thien Hue province is a testament to the efficacy of anticipatory action in minimizing the impact of disasters on vulnerable communities.  It is also a testament to our collective capacities to efficiently respond to emergencies. By anticipating the needs of vulnerable communities and pre-positioning resources, we can significantly reduce the impact of disasters and expedite the recovery process. This would not be possible without the strong commitment of the Government, technical support from UN, and from INGO partners in Vietnam.\n\nLooking ahead, we must explore innovative strategies to enhance our collaboration and the effectiveness of our disaster response beyond anticipatory action. This includes setting up systems to collect timely and reliable sex disaggrated data in emergency situations that can guide our response to the most vulnerable amongst us, especially children. Close collaboration within the DRRP, as well as with national and international partners, will be crucial in leveraging resources and expertise to build a more resilient and sustainable future for all.\n\nAs we embark on a new chapter in the Disaster Risk Reduction Partnership, I am confident that with renewed commitment, our collective efforts will continue to make a meaningful impact on the lives of vulnerable communities. The story of Mrs. Tran Thi Tinh reminds us why and how our collective efforts have the power to transform societies -- where no one is left behind -- even in the face of worsening disasters.\n\nThank you! Xin cam on!"}]}

GDP per capita grew from US$2,761 in 2016 to US$4,284.5 in 2023. Multi-dimensional poverty decreased from 9.2% in 2016 to 3.2% in 2023. Despite COVID-19 setbacks, the Human Development Index (HDI) increased to 0.726 in 2022, having achieved High Human Development country status since 2019.\n\nBuilding upon these commendable achievements, Viet Nam is committed to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Viet Nam also aspires to become a High-Income Country (HIC) by 2045 and realize net zero emissions targets by 2050.\n\nCritical development challenges remain. Along with rising global economic and trade fragmentation  and rapidly aging population, Viet Nam is also increasingly affected by climate risks. While Viet Nam’s 2023 Voluntary National Review (VNR) documents considerable progress in goals and targets related to poverty reduction, access to safe water and sanitation, and industrial and infrastructure development -- there is urgency to make progress in goals and targets such as protecting biodiversity and improving ecosystem services (SDG 15). Viet Nam, thus, needs to boost implementation and investments to bring all SDGs back on track to achieve the 2030 targets.\n\nTherefore, a fundamental shift needs to take place in Viet Nam’s economic development model -- to be more sustainable, resilient and inclusive. A model that puts people at the centre of development and can ensure environmental sustainability is essential for ensuring durable and long-term economic prosperity and social solidarity.\n\nThe Government is committed to this shift, as clearly demonstrated, for example, in its pledge for net-zero emissions at the UN Climate Change Conference of the Party (COP26) in Glasgow in 2021. Along with other policies and strategies, the Government has also introduced the National Green Growth Strategy 2021-2030 and the latest Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) in 2022.\n\nDistinguished participants,\n\nWhy do we need a green taxonomy?\n\nLet me highlight three points:\n\nFirst, what is a green taxonomy? According to the UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UNESCAP), “A taxonomy in green and sustainable finance is a classification system that helps identify and classify investments as green based on their alignment with specific environmental objectives and targets.”\n\nSecond, green taxonomy plays an important role in unlocking finance to support sustainable development. Green taxonomy is one of the policy tools that can help orient the flows of public and private capital or investments into green and sustainable projects that are aligned with environmental objectives. As green taxonomy provides common framework and language for identifying and classifying environmentally sustainable economic activities and assets, it helps policymakers and investors to make informed economic decisions and take actions in alignment with SDGs and environmental sustainability.\n\nThird, although there may be different approaches to developing a green taxonomy, it is important to establish key principles for developing a taxonomy that is applicable and useful for supporting the country’s sustainable development.\n\nIn this regard, to contribute to the deliberations of the green taxonomy development for Viet Nam, I would like to underline two key principles for consideration:\n\nIn closing,I reiterate our collective commitment to foster inclusive and sustainable development. For this to happen, we need to have economic and financial systems that are focused on delivering prosperity not only for the present, but future generations as well.\n\nThank you! Xin cam on!"}]}

First, please allow me to thank the Venezuelan Ambassador, the Dean of our Diplomatic Corps in Viet Nam, His Excellency Ambassador Uzcategui, for his leadership in bringing us together here today. As partners in support of this unique country, it is our duty to continually strengthen our mutual engagement. And, today's lunch offers excellent opportunities to do precisely that – to better position and focus our collective actions. These collective actions must support Viet Nam on the core development challenges that it faces.\n\nColleagues and friends,\n\nWe need to reflect at least a moment – ideally longer – on how we define our actions? How do we ensure that these are ultimately contributing positively to the lives of the people of Viet Nam?\n\nWe have given ourselves multilateral and bilateral instruments and organizations, which aim to channel our actions. Agenda 2030, which all of your respective governments and organizations have endorsed and now support through the United Nations, is one of those critical instruments. Under the banner of Agenda 2030, as well as the UN's wide-ranging set of agreed international norms and standards, the United Nations is uniquely placed to continue to build impartial bridges and platforms to give a voice to diverse views and constituencies, and to guide the international and Vietnamese community on abiding by universal values as we collectively support the people of this country.\n\nAs you know, the UN in Viet Nam has a long and special history. UN agencies were among the first international partners on the ground to support Viet Nam with humanitarian assistance after the end of the war in 1975. And ever since, the UN System has actively engaged, at global, regional, national, and sub-national levels to support Viet Nam. This support, manifested in strong partnerships with both the Government and people of Viet Nam for over four decades now, involving many of your countries or organizations, has focused on helping Viet Nam recover from some of the most severe consequences of the war, on restoring domestic production and the wider economy, and on helping the country transform itself into a modern forward-looking nation. This also included critical UN support to undertake reforms towards a socialist oriented market economy - 'Doi Moi', long before either the World Bank, IMF, or many of your countries had formal relationships with Viet Nam.\n\nMy fellow colleagues and friends in the Diplomatic Corps,\n\nOn a number of fronts, Viet Nam is a success story. The transformation of the last few decades is striking. While it is undeniable that challenges remain, and that the challenges themselves are becoming increasingly complex, we can all agree that Viet Nam's transformation over the last four decades to where it stands today is remarkable, especially when we consider its still recent history over the three decades before 1975.\n\nWe have all played a part in the transformation of Viet Nam, under the strong leadership of the people and Government of this country. Going forward, it is thus critical for all of us to consider how we will tailor our actions in such a manner that best addresses these increasingly complex challenges.\n\nIn July last year, I signed the One UN Strategic Plan for the 2017-2021 period on behalf of 18 UN agencies with the Government of Viet Nam. This is a third generation One UN strategic cooperation framework. And, it is designed around the central themes of Agenda 2030: People, Planet, Prosperity, and Peace. The key purpose of the 2030 Agenda is to \"leave no one behind\". This remains at the core of the values we espouse as United Nations staff; and in this I believe I can also safely include all of you, representing Members States of the United Nations.\n\nViet Nam has also made significant contributions to the Delivering as One UN reform efforts, which this country has piloted from their global inception in 2006. The results of these experiences have strengthened the UN's coherence on programme, policy, advocacy and operations, also leading to the establishment of the Green One UN House in Hanoi, which is now one of the UN's cutting edge integrated facilities in the world. Many of you have visited us there but many of you have not. I would encourage all of you who have not yet visited to pay a visit to my UN colleagues and me there soon.\n\nThe last decade of UN reform experiences has further served to inform a new set of reforms of the UN Development System, currently being directly led by the UN Secretary General with Member States who are due to decide on many new reforms to the UN Development System, the UN's peace and security architecture and management reform in 2018. The proposed reforms are completely consistent with the thrust of the One UN reforms which the UN in Viet Nam has pioneered and is in the forefront of. This means that Viet Nam will continue to be a pioneer of and will remain at the forefront of the global UN Development System reform agenda.\n\nLadies and gentlemen,\n\nIt is my hope that the final set of UN reforms to be agreed by Member States this year, will allow us as a UN family, in partnership with all of you, to better contribute to the development trajectory of Viet Nam. This ultimately, should support us in tackling the increasingly complex challenges faced by Viet Nam.\n\nPlease allow me to highlight four such domestic challenges, which are top priorities for the UN in Viet Nam, going forward: First, the increased frequency of devastating weather-related events highlights Viet Nam's very high vulnerability to both climate change and disaster risk, and special emphasis in this regard will need to be placed on the near-poor \"missing middle\" population, which has only too recently escaped poverty but remains vulnerable to slipping back into it.\n\nSecond, measures that increase Viet Nam's competitiveness, productivity and innovation, while simultaneously promoting a green, resilient, economy are essential. This should include an emphasis on promoting 21st Century skills in the context of Industrial Revolution 4.0. In this context, special attention needs to be paid to supporting Vietnamese micro, small and medium enterprises.\n\nThird, a stronger emphasis should be placed by the Government on a 'whole of society' partnership approach, more actively embracing the private sector and civil society in Viet Nam. This should include a strong focus on empowering women and groups such as ethnic minorities and those who have been 'left behind' by previous and current approaches to development in Viet Nam.\n\nFourth, while Viet Nam has signed and ratified several of the UN's human rights conventions and treaties, and we applaud and appreciate that, the UN system has increasingly expressed concerns regarding freedom of expression, association, and movement, arbitrary arrests and detention of human rights defenders, bloggers and activists, and the ongoing use of the death penalty, amongst other human rights issues such as gender equality and labor rights. These will need to be addressed in a progressive and realistic manner. On this, please allow me to highlight that in January 2019, Viet Nam will undergo its third Universal Periodic Review (UPR) under the UN's Human Rights Council. The UN has already initiated consultations and support for Government and Civil Society efforts on UPR reporting, and as the UN Resident Coordinator I am mandated to transmit the UN in Viet Nam's report for Vietnam's third UPR to Geneva in early July this year.\n\nLadies and Gentlemen,\n\nLast but not least, there is increasing UN support for what I call the \"global give-back\" agenda. This has two immediate elements which the UN and I are prioritizing and a third element for the medium to long-term.\n\nFirst, South-South and triangular cooperation is strategically relevant to low income countries and those in fragile or conflict contexts and they can best learn from countries like Viet Nam which have recently graduated from all three contexts: Vietnam is no longer low income, fragile or in conflict! The triangular part is where UN member states, especially more advanced countries, have an important role to play.\n\nSecond, support for Viet Nam's role in and contribution to global peacekeeping, going full circle, from a country which was in conflict for decades on end to one which makes a major contribution to maintaining the peace in other protracted conflict situations around the world. I have been advocating for a coordinated long-term peacekeeping strategy for Viet Nam under the overall leadership and coordination of the Government and the UN rather than the current fragmented approach of the Government and many donors to Viet Nam in this area and we hope to co-convene with the Government a seminar on peacekeeping with this objective in mind this summer which I hope many of you will attend and support.\n\nThese two agendas need immediate action and we are providing it. The third, building up Viet Nam's institutional capacity to develop a development cooperation programme and/or agency is longer-term but worth thinking about from now onwards.\n\nColleagues, while the challenges I have highlighted are formidable, I am convinced that our collective actions can support Viet Nam to address them. We are fortunate to serve and work in a country with high levels of ambition. The success of the recent APEC Summit pays testimony to that, and to Viet Nam's repeatedly demonstrated ability to forge new positive paths and reach new heights when there is a collective decision of its top political leadership which enables this.\n\nPlease allow me to conclude by emphasizing that the UN, with the support of all of you representing our Member States, will continue to support Viet Nam in its efforts at tackling its remaining and emerging challenges. We look forward to continuing to do this together with all of you, consistent with our jointly agreed Agenda 2030 global framework. The UN will, in particular, continue to serve as a catalyst to broker knowledge and best international expertise and provide policy advice based on best practices from both the wider UN System as well as from all stakeholders.\n\nColleagues, as I already said at the beginning, there is no free lunch, and I hope that my reflections have given you enough food for thought.\n\nI hope that they will stimulate interesting discussions over our remaining lunch!\n\nThank you for your attention."}]}

After sustained efforts over several years, it is a great achievement for all of us to be here to launch the EU Justice and Legal Empowerment programme.\n\nI have repeated on many occasions since I arrived in Viet Nam last year that I have always believed that this programme is crucial for Viet Nam and its future development. Indeed, if Viet Nam is to make the transition to upper middle-income status successfully by 2035, rule of law and good governance will be as important for that transition as good economic indicators. The UN is pleased to be part of this programme both as a co-donor and an implementing partner.\n\nThe overall objective of the Programme is to strengthen the rule of law through a more reliable, trusted and better accessed justice system. Through an ambitious set of interventions, we will seek to increase access to justice for women, children and vulnerable groups, including ethnic minorities and poor people to ensure that no one is left behind. As you know, this is a central principle of the UN's global 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\n\nCollection of reliable data on access to justice to guide future policy-making will be an important part of the programme. Through data collection and analysis, we will identify which populations face the greatest challenges in accessing legal information and the justice system and we will support Government actors, both at the national and provincial levels, in addressing these challenges to increase access to justice for the most vulnerable.\n\nOver the coming years, UNDP, UNICEF and UNODC will work together with Viet Namese partners to achieve four results (i) Increased public awareness and understanding of rights and how to invoke those legitimate rights in accordance with Viet Namese law; (ii) Increased access to legal advice, assistance and representation in both civil and criminal matters; (iii) Improved enabling legislative and regulatory framework for legal empowerment and access to justice; and (iv) Enhanced integrity and transparency in the justice sector.\n\nRecognizing that these results do not fall under the responsibility of one Agency alone, we will work closely with a range of Viet Namese institutions and organisations, including the Ministry of Justice (MOJ), the Supreme People's Court (SPC), the Supreme People's Procuracy (SPP), the Ministry of Public Security (MPS), the Viet Nam Lawyers' Association (VLA), the Viet Nam Bar Federation (VBF), the National Assembly and many others. It is also worth noting that the programme also involves activities with law universities and research institutions relating to law and justice, non-governmental organizations, and the media. We look forward to working closely with all these Agencies to achieve results for those who are intended to benefit from this project.\n\nIt is important to link the programme with both the SDG and human rights agendas. Just several months ago, on 16 July, Viet Nam presented its Voluntary National Review on SDG implementation to the UN's High Level Political Forum in New York. The key SDG 16 aims to strengthen the rule of law and promote human rights. One dimension of the rule of law is to ensure that laws comply with international norms and standards, including on human rights. Another dimension of the rule of law is to ensure that these laws are implemented across the country. This programme will help Viet Nam implement SDG16. Additionally, it will assist Viet Nam in implementing some of its human rights commitments. The programme comes at an opportune time when Viet Nam will undergo its next Universal Periodic Review in Geneva early next year.\n\nThree UN agencies, namely UNDP, UNICEF and UNODC, will draw on their respective expertise to implement the programme together with Government and other partners. Each of the three agencies have a long history of engagement with the Government and people of Viet Nam in the area of justice. Building on this long standing trusted partnership with Viet Nam, we are confident that we can support the Government in delivering top level results in the areas of rule of law and access to justice.\n\nAllow me to conclude by saying that the UN stands fully ready to implement the programme in partnership with the Government of Viet Nam, with the Ministry of Justice as the lead partner, but also with all our other related partners in the law and justice sector, with whom we expect to work directly on this programme. The two components of the EU JULE programme, PAGoDA and JIFF, are interrelated and we will continue to coordinate closely with Oxfam during the implementation phase. I first came to Viet Nam in 1989 when I was the Director of the Overseas and Aboriginal Programme of what is now Oxfam Australia, and my visits in the early 1990s were also in that role so I am very pleased to be collaborating with Oxfam in Viet Nam again and look forward to it. We hope, thereby, to support ongoing efforts to sustainably improve the rule of law and access to justice in Viet Nam. I would also like to take this opportunity to thank the Delegation of the European Union for making this cooperation possible. We look forward to working with all of you to make this project a success.\n\nThank you! Xin cảm ơn!"}]}

I am very pleased to see such a good turn-out and the attention that you are giving to the topics that will be discussed through 6 half-day sessions this week. As we are frequently reminded, climate change is the defining issue of our time and, according to many reports, we only have about 12 years to act together if we are to reduce catastrophic impacts on our societies, as warned by the 2018 IPCC Special report on Global Warming. The 2018 UN Emission Gap report on current national climate pledges at the same time notes that the current Nationally Determined Contributions have set our planet on a path towards a global average temperature increase of 3ºC which is much greater than and therefore below the ambition of the Paris Agreement that aims to keep global average temperature increases well below 2ºC.The UN system has a key role to play in supporting countries in their climate change mitigation and adaptation actions. The 2015 Paris Climate Agreement and the Sustainable Development Goals together provide a realistic and very good framework for us to act jointly. But there is a need for all countries to accelerate action and increase ambition. To this end, the UN Secretary-General António Guterres is calling a Climate Action Summit inviting all leaders to come to New York on 23 September this year with concrete, realistic plans to enhance their nationally determined contributions by 2020, in line with the objective of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 45 per cent over the next decade, with the objective of achieving net zero emissions by 2050.Preparations for this Summit are already well under way and a preparatory meeting will be held between 31 June - 1 July in the United Arab Emirates.At country level, UN Resident Coordinators were asked by the UN Secretary General to lead efforts to help make the Summit a success and help support governments to increase their ambitions and particularly to identify key challenges and opportunities around the six transformative areas which the September Summit will cover: 1)energy transition, 2)industry transition, 3)infrastructure cities and local action, 4)resilience and adaptation, 5)nature-based solutions and 6)climate finance and carbon pricing. In addition, three cross-cutting themes across each of these six transformative areas will be discussed at the Summit focusing on mobilization of society, raising ambition, and bringing together synergies of key players’ mitigation strategies.The UNCT Results Group on Climate Change and and Environment chaired by Dr. Albert Lieberg and with Caitlin Wiesen as Vice Chair, and within that UNDP, given its work in this area over many years, has been tasked by me to lead our support in this area (in close cooperation with other members of the Results Group) to the Government of Viet Nam through a jointly constituted working group I agreed with the Minister of Natural Resources and Environment.These discussions are meant to help the UN Secretary General and global leaders identify the most effective actions that need to be urgently taken at both global and country levels. The UN in Viet Nam is here to listen to and note ideas which merit attention. My UN colleagues will listen attentively to and capture the most relevant ideas and share them with relevant stakeholders for their follow-up actions.Thank you for coming today."}]}

I would also like to especially thank the Honorable Vice-Minister, Mr. Nguyen Viet Tien, for his inspiring opening speech.\n\nAs you know, this study was developed by the Ministry of Health, with technical and financial support from UNFPA. We would like to thank the research team, particularly Dr. Abul Barkat, Dr. Avijit Poddar (HDRC), Dr. Tran Tuan and Ms. Tran Thu Ha (RTCCD) for their substantial contributions to all phases of the study. We would also like to thank the General Office for Population and Family Planning (GOPFP) and relevant experts from the Ministry of Health, particularly Deputy Director in-charge of GOPFP Mr. Nguyen Van Tan for his encouragement and invaluable support for the research team during the study. And of course, we would particularly like to thank all members of the data collection team (enumerators and supervisors) for their hard work and commitment to high-quality data.\n\nDistinguished guests,\n\nViet Nam – and the world – has embarked on the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, underpinned by the 17 Sustainable Development Goals. We seek to achieve a life of dignity for all in order to truly leave no one behind.\n\nAt UNFPA, we are about to embark on a Strategic Plan to fulfill three transformational zero goals for our region and our world:\n\nThese three goals are based on a platform of population data for development and are enshrined in the 2030 Agenda, as well as the Programme of Action that emerged from the 1994 International Conference on Population and Development. Both continue to guide our work as we shift policy from words into action – and are both as relevant today than ever.\n\nGlobally, some 214 million women want to avoid or delay childbearing. Why should they lack access to quality services and supplies, including modern contraception. Among them are 6.3 million sexually active adolescent girls in Asia and the Pacific. Without expression of rights and quality services for these precious young lives, we will continue to have the estimated 3.6 million unsafe abortions among young women in this region every year.\n\nAnd we will see millions of new cases of sexually transmitted infections. These combined epidemics have a profound impact: on the health and lives of children, adolescents and adults including causing fetal and neonatal deaths; cervical cancer; infertility; HIV risk; and physical, psychological and social consequences that can severely compromise the quality of life of those infected.\n\nDistinguished guests,\n\nOver the past four decades, Viet Nam has made considerable improvements in its family planning service delivery system. The total fertility rate has fallen from an average of 5 children per couple (recorded in the 1970s) to replacement level at 2.09 in 2016. The Modern contraceptive prevalence rate increased from 37 per cent in 1988 to 67 per cent in 2016. The Maternal mortality rate has fallen from 233 per 100,000 live births in the 1990s to 69 per 100,000 live births in 2009 and 58.3 per 100,000 live births in 2016 – a dramatic improvement.\n\nThe study found that the overall Contraceptive prevalence rate (CPR) was very high at 80.5%, and highest in the Southeastern Region (83.4%) and lowest in the Red River Delta (75.1%). The CPR is higher in urban areas than rural areas. The highest CPR, found in the Southeastern region, was associated with the highest use of traditional methods (27.2%). At the same time, the lowest CPR, in the Red River Delta, was associated with the lowest use of traditional methods (10.5%). These data suggest reliance on traditional methods as opposed to use of modern methods, and indicate a need to consider means of transforming traditional method users into informed users of modern methods.\n\nLadies and gentlemen,\n\nBefore giving the floor to my colleagues to present key findings of these reports, I would like to reiterate a few key messages and calls for action that are highlighted in the reports:\n\nFirstly, as the contraceptive mix is still skewed toward female methods, vigorous behavioral change communication activities should be arranged to encourage male participation in family planning to increase the use of male methods such as male condoms.\n\nSecondly, given high traditional contraceptive use and its high failure rate, GOPFP should develop an effective communication strategy to minimize traditional method use and increase the use of modern contraceptives, particularly in the Southeastern region. To further widen the scope of informed client choice, counseling should provide more information on various aspects of family planning services (advantages and disadvantages, side effects, instructions on proper use of methods, etc.) as well as address needs of new clients and those intending to switch methods.\n\nFinally, given the significant role of Population Collaborators in providing non-clinical methods (with a very high discontinuation rate), GOPFP should develop national guidelines on monitoring and technical backstopping the performance of these important family planning providers.\n\nDistinguished guests,\n\nAccess to safe, voluntary family planning is a human right. Family planning is central to gender equality and women's empowerment, and it is a key factor in reducing poverty. Achieving the world's Sustainable Development Goals by 2030 will depend significantly on how well the sexual and reproductive health and rights of women and young people are fulfilled. Catering to their unmet need for family planning is among the most cost-effective investments overall.\n\nUNFPA in Viet Nam is fully committed to support the Government and people of Viet Nam to ensure that universal access to health, including sexual and reproductive health, will become a reality for all. Together, we can build a future where zero is the only acceptable number: zero maternal deaths, zero unmet demand for family planning, and zero violence and harmful practices against women and girls. Where we fulfill the hopes and dreams for a future for Viet Nam where absolutely no one is left behind.\n\nIn conclusion, I would like to quote Dr. Babatunde Osotimehin, our Former Executive Director, with a call to action: \"Until every girl, every woman, everybody wherever they may be, can access reproductive health services, especially family planning, the work is not done.\"\n\nOur work is not done. When it comes to unmet need for family planning, the only acceptable number is zero.\n\nThank you very much for your attention and participation. I look forward to discussing these issues with you further during this workshop."}]}

I am glad to see many men here today and am pleased to note that both Deputy Minister Diep representing the Government and myself representing the UN are men who support enhancement of gender relations.\n\nIt is my great pleasure to open this event to mark International Women's Day in Viet Nam.\n\nThis year, across the world, we are gathering to shed light on \"Challenges and opportunities in achieving gender equality and the empowerment of rural women and girls\" as the theme of International Women's Day.\n\nEach year, the UN system champions the rights of rural women on the International Day for Rural Women. In 2018, the Commission on the Status of Women, the CSW, the principal global intergovernmental body exclusively dedicated to gender equality and the empowerment of women, will tackle the challenges and opportunities facing rural women as a priority theme. The CSW has called for tearing down the barriers to rural women and girls worldwide.\n\nOver the last two decades, Viet Nam has made impressive progress in improving people's well-being and reducing gender inequalities, including in rural areas. In particular, Viet Nam achieved a major decline in the maternal mortality rate and there is no longer a significant difference in net enrollment rates between girls and boys in primary and lower secondary education. These are significant achievements which we should applaud and congratulate the Government and people of Viet Nam for.\n\nHowever, the review of the 20-year implementation of the Beijing Platform for Action has revealed disparities when we take a closer look at the disaggregated data. For example, the maternal mortality rate was four times higher for ethnic minority mothers in comparison to that of Kinh mothers.\n\nLadies and gentlemen,\n\nRural women are not a homogenous group. One may be a rural woman who works from daybreak until sundown and often beyond. Another one may run a small business or cultivate a field or both to support her family. Another may tend livestock. Many spend long hours collecting water and fuel, and preparing food. Most have the primary responsibility of raising children. Rural women workers include migrants within and across national borders, trafficked workers, those in situations of forced labour and debt bondage.\n\nWithout rural women and girls, rural communities would not function.\n\nYet women and girls are amongst the people most likely to be poor or vulnerable, to lack access to assets, education, health care and other essential services, and to be hit hardest by climate change and other man-made, and I stress MAN-MADE (not women-made) disasters!\n\nMember states, including Viet Nam, have committed to upholding the rights of all women and girls. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development laid a solid foundation for achieving gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls and sustainable development. Fulfilling this commitment is particularly urgent in rural areas.\n\nAround the world, including in Viet Nam, rural women and girls still face multiple burdens, intersecting inequalities and forms of discrimination, especially young women and girls, older women, heads of households, indigenous women, women affected by HIV and AIDS, women with disabilities, migrant women, refugees and internally-displaced women and girls. It is also acknowledged that different groups of rural women and girls have particular needs and priorities, requiring tailored policies and institutional responses.\n\nIf we look at Viet Nam, it is undeniable that the country has achieved remarkable economic growth in the past 30 years with a significant contribution from the agricultural sector which remains the employer of about half of the labour force and is by far the main source of livelihood for the ethnic minority population. Women constitute a critical workforce in agricultural production, especially in rural areas where 63.4% of working women are in agriculture compared to 57.5% of working men. It is clear that rural women are contributing significantly to both Viet Nam's agricultural and overall economic growth.\n\nHowever, we also have evidence that the country's economic growth is not necessarily translating into greater gender equality for all, particularly for rural women and girls. I would like to share some examples of the major challenges faced in rural areas to give you a sense of the gender inequalities that still remain, despite Viet Nam's enormous progress. The issues I raise below are in abbreviated form because of the limitations of time, and will be elaborated in more detail in later presentations I am told:\n\nFirst, traditionally, women are more involved in agriculture because of their double burden of unpaid care work and because of their generally lower educational and technical qualifications compared with men. More rural women than men are in vulnerable employment due to a larger share of women working as unpaid family workers, such as on family farms or in family business, with no independent access to income.\n\nSecond, while access to productive resources such as land, modern inputs, technology and financial services are all critical determinants of agricultural productivity, women's access to these resources remains limited. Women are also more likely to own and operate smaller farms and cultivate subsistence crops, often requiring them to rely on multiple jobs for survival.\n\nThird, women's unequal access to land rights has major ramifications for their access to credit, as land use rights certificates are generally required by banks as collateral. This is compounded by their limited access to formal credit sources, while preferential credit policies have little impact on the income levels and poverty reduction of women and girls. As female farmers face difficulty accessing formal credit, they are disproportionately, compared to rural men, dependent on informal credit networks in rural areas.\n\nFourth, most rural women and men work in the informal sector, because the Labour Code of Viet Nam only applies to workers in the formal sector. Therefore, rural women's universal access to social protection programmes, including social assistance, social insurance and labour market programmes that provide paid maternity leave, care for illness and disability, and the right to work in a safe and healthy workplace are not guaranteed.\n\nFifth, for many rural women, limited economic opportunities push them to migrate in search of better work and lives in cities and urban areas. Although migrant women have a diverse array of skills and experience, continuing demand for domestic and care work in many cities means these women often fill such jobs, without basic social protection.\n\nSixth, rural women are also disproportionately affected by the impacts of climate change because disasters can increase their time spent to collect water, food and fuel, which are primarily women's responsibilities. Nevertheless, existing gender stereotypes limit women from taking part in planning and decision making on disaster risk preparedness and climate change adaptation.\n\nThe social and economic injustices rural women continue to experience should not be viewed as inevitable; they are the result of global and local policymaking intersecting with entrenched historical and patriarchal practices.\n\nLadies and gentlemen,\n\nThe Sustainable Development Goals seek to leave no one behind, and that means no woman or girl should be left behind.\n\nTransforming rural women's lives will require both the elimination of structural barriers and discriminatory laws and the transformation of social norms in a direction which creates equal opportunities and outcomes. Let me now offer a few recommendations in conclusion.\n\nFirst, both targeted gender action and mainstreaming gender perspectives into all efforts will continue to be required in national planning, decision making, policy formulation and implementation, budgeting processes and institutional structures to achieve gender equality and the empowerment of rural women and girls.\n\nSecondly, we need an enabling environment for rural women and girls and their organizations and other support structures to fully and actively participate in the decisions, policies and institutions that affect their livelihoods, well-being and resilience. This includes supporting the effective participation, decision-making and leadership of rural women in enterprises, farmers' organizations, producer cooperatives and other civil society organizations.\n\nThirdly, resilience to climate change and environmental degradation, such as deforestation, desertification and loss of agricultural biodiversity can be strengthened by supporting rural women's access to financing, natural resources, sustainable energy, technologies, information and social protection.\n\nLast but certainly not the least, the government of Viet Nam must increase the capacity of national statistical offices and other relevant institutions to collect, analyze and disseminate sex- and age-disaggregated data and produce up-to-date gender statistics to support policies and action for rural women and girls which also enable the monitoring and the tracking of progress towards Agenda 2030 and SDG achievement.\n\nI hope today's dialogue will mark an important milestone in our collective journey – one where we both pause to reflect on and celebrate the significant progress that has been made in Viet Nam but also recognize how much more Viet Nam needs to do. We cannot become complacent and more than celebrating the progress, we need to use this opportunity today to make the necessary commitments and investment to bring about lasting change and transformation for gender equality in Viet Nam.\n\nThe United Nations, as usual, stands ready to support the Government and people of Viet Nam in this important continuing journey.\n\nXin Cảm Ơn!"}]}

I would like to thank the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and UNDP for co-hosting this event, and the Embassy of Norway for their support. This is the first dialogue that brings together the Government, the international community, and civil society to discuss the nexus between climate change and human rights. This dialogue also comes at the heels of yesterday’s adoption of the UN General Assembly resolution recognizing the human right to a healthy environment, an important accountability tool for climate justice.\n\nToday, we focus on this important topic at a very critical time for our planet and humankind. As UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has stressed, “Our world faces a triple planetary crisis of climate change, nature loss and pollution. This triple planetary crisis is our number one existential threat.” Indeed, human life depends on the environment in which we live, but at the same time, we can take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts.\n\nAs Assistant Minister Viet has already highlighted, let me emphasize that Viet Nam is among the world’s most vulnerable countries to climate change and natural disasters. The impacts have already been significant, with a loss of 3.2% of GDP in 2020. It has also been estimated that climate change could reduce national income by up to 3.5% by 2050. But beyond the costs to the economy that undermines Viet Nam’s growth, we think about those whose lives and livelihoods are most affected by the extreme events, hotter temperatures, and rising sea levels.\n\nClimate vulnerability affects more than 74% of Viet Nam’s population. Consider amongst them the families who lose their houses in storms and floods, the children whose health deteriorates in their early life from being exposed to air pollution resulting from coal power and other emissions, and the women and girls who face increased risks of violence during crises and disasters, or the poorest, most marginalized and most vulnerable who may not be able to move away from being exposed to climate hazards and are forced to stay in situations of impoverishment. How can we address the climate change impacts on the rights to adequate food, water, education, housing, health, development, and even life itself?\n\nDistinguished guests,\n\nWhen we press for climate action, we are promoting human rights. As we are faced with the realities of the triple planetary crisis, I wanted to highlight a few areas that are important in guiding our responses. These are also consistent with the Human Rights Council resolution that Viet Nam has sponsored together with the Philippines and Bangladesh.\n\nFirst,climate change is a human rights problem, and therefore human rights-based approaches must be at the centre of the solution. We must take affirmative steps in climate actions to protect, promote and fulfil all human rights for all persons, by integrating human rights and effective governance in climate actions and policies, empowering rights holders to participate in dialogue and policy formulation, and ensuring accountability of duty-bearers for their actions.\n\nSecond,emphasizing the commitment to dialogue and human rights for all that Assistant Minister Viet has mentioned in his remarks, allow me to stress the necessity of increased and meaningful participation of all sectors of society, including diverse non-governmental actors. Civil society and communities are fundamental partners in helping Viet Nam accelerate progress in achieving its COP26 commitments and the Sustainable Development Goals. As we make decisions that affect future generations, I turn towards the young people who are transforming today’s challenges into tomorrow’s solutions. We must create a space not only for their voices to be heard but also for them to shape the decisions that will affect their own future.\n\nThird,it is critical to strengthen awareness and education on human rights and their linkages across all areas of development, from the earliest school age. This means promoting universal human rights values that encourage all individuals to uphold their own rights and those of others. This also means developing a collective understanding that everyone has the responsibility to make human rights a reality in each community. Knowledge is at the heart of empowering agents of change who can inspire action to realise the human rights of all people.\n\nDistinguished guests,\n\nViet Nam is on the path to achieving its ambitious goals of achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 and phasing out coal by the 2040s. I would like to affirm that the UN in Viet Nam will work closely with the Government, development partners and civil society, to ensure that Viet Nam’s climate actions and energy transition are inclusive and just, based on the rule of law.\n\nAs Viet Nam seeks membership at the UN Human Rights Council for the term 2023-2025, the fulfilment of international human rights obligations through the Universal Periodic Review and the seven international human rights treaties that Viet Nam has ratified becomes even more critical. I would like to commend Viet Nam for submitting voluntary pledges as part of its candidacy to the Human Rights Council, and I am further encouraged that these voluntary pledges give particular attention to the rights of vulnerable groups and the impacts of climate change on the enjoyment of human rights. UN agencies in Viet Nam, in close collaboration with the Office of the High Commissioner on Human Rights, stand ready to support Viet Nam in implementing these pledges.\n\nI am certain that with the Government’s commitment at the highest level, with the meaningful partnerships and collective engagement of all stakeholders, and with the shared vision of advancing both climate action and human rights, we can hope for an inclusive, just, and sustainable future for people and our planet."}]}

Thank you for your valuable time and hospitality.\n\nToday we celebrate the 79th anniversary of the United Nations and the 47th year of Viet Nam’s membership in the UN.\n\nOur celebrations come on the heels of the Summit of the Future -- where Heads of States, including Party General Secretary, H.E. Mr. To Lam, strongly reaffirmed commitment to multilateralism, to the United Nations, its mandate and its mission in a highly volatile and uncertain global context.\n\nTogether with other countries, Viet Nam signed the Pact for the Future to turbocharge the Sustainable Development Goals and the Paris Agreement -- accelerating a just transition away from fossil fuels and securing a peaceful and liveable future for everyone on our planet.\n\nAt the Summit, Viet Nam also committed to the first truly universal agreement on the international governance of Artificial Intelligence – the Global Digital Compact. The Compact is based on the principle that technology should benefit everyone.\n\nViet Nam also agreed to the Declaration on Future Generations. It echoes the call of the UN Charter to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war. The Declaration includes a groundbreaking commitment by governments to listen to young people and include them in decision-making, at the national and global levels.\n\nRespect for human rights, cultural diversity and gender equality are woven into all three agreements. As a member of the Human Rights Council, Viet Nam has much to offer in this regard.\n\nYour Excellency,\n\nViet Nam’s proactive engagement and leadership at the Summit demonstrates a strong commitment to uphold the values of the UN Charter and to ensure that global institutions are fit for purpose in the 21st century.\n\nA much-needed solidarity at a time of global turbulence.\n\nThis is what we celebrate this evening – an ever-deepening partnership between the Government of Viet Nam and the UN.\n\nAt the heart of our partnership is our common aspiration to accelerate the Sustainable Development Goals.\n\nThe SDGs represent a bold vision: a commitment to a better, healthier, safer and more prosperous and sustainable future, that leaves no one behind. Inclusive and sustainable development is our best response to prevent crisis and protect from future shocks.\n\nThis vision underpins the joint UN-Government of Viet Nam Cooperation Framework for the period 2022 to 2026.\n\n[Pause]\n\nAllow me, Your Excellency, to highlight four areas where we have achieved substantial progress together in the past year. I will also point to where we need to do better.\n\nFirst, closely aligned with the vision of Vietnam’s leadership, we believe that investing in human capital and inclusive social development will drive Viet Nam’s prosperity. The UN has worked hand-in-hand with relevant ministries and partners in transforming education, improving health care, including maternal health care for rural communities, addressing severe malnutrition in children, reducing inequalities, strengthening national capacity for water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH), and providing evidence-based policy options on social protection for the most vulnerable.\n\nSecond, the UN stepped up support to the Government’s ambitious net-zero commitments, building on inclusive and innovative multi-sectoral initiatives on climate action, disaster resilience and environmental sustainability. Support to the Just Energy Transition Partnership (JETP) and innovations in agrifood systems transformation are two examples to highlight. The most recent Joint Response to Typhoon Yagi and floods also showcases our joint actions for the most vulnerable communities to build back better.\n\nI take this opportunity to appreciate the leadership of MARD/VDDMA in the Typhoon Yagi response. Together, we will continue to build resilience to disasters and climate shocks, including through the Joint Response Plan and the on-going Viet Nam Multi-sectoral assessment. These will pave the way for prevention and preparedness in the future.\n\nYour Excellency, the third area to highlight --\n\nTogether we are helping to build the ecosystem for responsible business, circular economy and digital transformation. We know that the rapid advancement of emerging technologies, particularly artificial intelligence (AI), is reshaping economies and societies globally and locally. While AI offers significant advantages, there are also serious concerns about potential risks -- such as on data security, data governance and privacy. These concerns led Viet Nam to adopt the first-ever global standard on AI ethics – the UNESCO Recommendation on Ethics of AI. This includes an assessment for AI readiness, which we have launched in close collaboration with the Ministry of Science and Technology in August. The readiness assessment will help identify strengths and gaps in AI governance, policies and infrastructure to advance accountability, transparency and the rule of law.\n\nFourth, we are jointly advancing women’s empowerment and participation -- contributing to the implementation of the National Strategy on Gender Equality and the National Action Plan (NAP) on Women, Peace, and Security (WPS). Together, we are working on eliminating violence against women and children, including support for the Decree on the Domestic Violence Prevention and Control Law. These are important contributions to Viet Nam’s implementation of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, the 30th anniversary of which we commemorate in 2025; and a critical platform to mark the start of Viet Nam’s tenure as member of the UN Women Executive Board.\n\n2025 will also mark the 35th anniversary of the Convention on the Rights of the Child that Viet Nam champions at the global and regional levels. We are by your side to continue investing in the next generation, to protect and prepare children and young people for the opportunities and challenges of today and tomorrow.\n\n[Pause]\n\nWhile considerable progress has been made, more needs to be done to reduce inequalities and ensure that no one is left behind to achieve the SDGs by 2030. Viet Nam’s 2nd Voluntary National Review identified priorities to accelerate SDG progress – all closely aligned with the Pact for the Future. This includes investing in human capital and digital transformation; strengthening public sector capacity and institutions; improving data; and mobilizing financing for the SDGs. We will redouble our efforts on these priorities in the remaining period of our cooperation framework.\n\nYour Excellency,\n\nSpecifically on SDG financing, I take this opportunity to appreciate MPI’s leadership in addressing ODA challenges. Efforts to revise the Public Investment Law are underway, and a comprehensive amendment to the State Budget Law is planned. This may take considerable time as per the legislative process of Viet Nam. Therefore, may we request, Your Excellency, to consider proposing a National Assembly  Standing Committee resolution enabling a separate decree on ODA grants. ODA grants remain a valuable source of knowledge, and a catalyst to leverage financing for the SDGs. And our ability to fully deliver on our joint Cooperation Framework commitments rests on solutions to ODA grants challenges.\n\n[Pause]\n\nInvesting in people, strengthening institutions, harnessing the power of data and digital technologies, protecting our planet --- will require leadership, resources and an enabling environment.\n\nWe will continue providing Viet Nam with knowledge, innovation, and international standards in developing people-centred and climate-related national policies, strategies and action plans; enhancing institutional capacities; and generating data and evidence for informed policymaking.\n\nIn a similar way, we are contributing policy options for consideration of the 14th Party Congress.\n\nOne such input draws from a joint UN-MPI macro-modeling study. It assessed the impact of green economy, poverty reduction, social protection and innovation-based growth policy scenarios on the economy, society and environment. The study also examined the fiscal space required for Viet Nam to achieve sustainable growth and net-zero targets.\n\nYour Excellency,\n\nPlease allow me to invite interventions from the UN Country Team to elaborate on our results, issues faced and offers of support.\n\nWe highly value Your Excellency’s focus on people, on inclusive socio-economic development, and on environmental protection.\n\nWe share the sense of urgency to ensure equitable, just and sustainable transitions -- including by combating poverty and exclusion and creating equitable access to services for all, especially the most vulnerable, including children, women, ethnic minorities, people with disabilities, LGBTIQ.\n\nWe therefore encourage the Government to ensure meaningful participation of all groups in society to achieve the SDGs and address development challenges together.\n\nI close by quoting the UN Secretary General, who at the Summit of the Future said, [Quote] “we will not solve today’s global problems without contributions from all of society … from civil society, young people … from business … from scientists, innovators and academics … pushing the boundaries of our knowledge and developing solutions to the great challenges that we face.” [End quote]\n\nThis is our commitment to Viet Nam – together, we can!\n\nCảm ơn Ngài và chính phủ Việt Nam!"}]}

This project is co-implemented by the General Statistics Office (GSO) of MPI; the Parliamentary Committee for Social Affairs (PCSA), and the Viet Nam’s Fatherland Front Central Committee (VFF). Participating partners include the Ministry of Justice (MOJ), the Central Committee on Popularization and Education (CCPE) and the Viet Nam National Committee on Ageing (VNCA). UNFPA Viet Nam is with you to provide any technical assistance needed. In a wider context, this project is an integral part of the One Strategic Plan, jointly delivered by the Government of Viet Nam and United Nations for the period 2017-2021.\n\nI would like to take this opportunity to thank the General Statistics Office and the co-implementing and participating partners for your strong efforts efforts to work with UNFPA in the past year to develop and finalize the Concept Note, the Proposal on Investment Policy (PIP) and the Project Document, the three vital documents, so that we can come together and launch the project today.\n\nDistinguished guests,\n\nThe 1994 International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) in Cairo to which Viet Nam is a signatory, was a milestone in the history of population and development, reproductive rights and women's rights to health.  The Conference called upon governments and development agencies to support for quality data for development with a wide range of researches and studies to inform public policy and improve programming strategies. Since ICPD, countries around the world, including Viet Nam, have invested a significant amount of resources for improving data provision and utilization for decision making. ICPD now forms part of the wide-range of development agendas, such as poverty reduction, advancement of women’s rights, or environment protection and meeting the challenges of climate change in many countries, including Viet Nam.\n\nData from the past Population and Housing Census and other population related surveys clearly show that Viet Nam is undergoing significant demographic changes: fertility rate has remained at the replacement level for more than a decade, declining mortality and increasing life expectancy, large scale migration process leading to significant and rapid changes in the population distribution between rural and urban areas; a skewed sex ratio at birth; the country has been in the period of demographic bonus with a large young population; while at the same time experiencing rapid population ageing. These demographic trends have critical impacts on the implementation of national, regional and local socio-economic development strategies and plans, and need to be integrated in the development of policies, strategies and plans at all level and sectors.\n\nLadies and gentlemen,\n\nNow, with the global commitment on achieving the SDGs and leaving “no one behind” by 2030, the availability of reliable, consistent and comparable statistical information has become more crucial than ever; and plays a more critical role not only in monitoring progress but also in the assessment and realignment of plans and strategies.\n\nLet me take this opportunity to highlight some messages as follows:\n\nFirst, more efforts are needed to ensure that the importance of data and statistics is fully understood and appreciated by all stakeholders, and there must be commitment and leadership for investing in high-quality data and statistics, and making them accessible. Improved quality of statistics and disaggregated data (by age, sex, rural-urban, provincial and other characteristics) will lead to more effective decision-making and better development policies.\n\nSecond, population related information and projections continue to be the foundation to develop socio-economic development strategies and plans,  address inequality in policy advocacy on population and development, climate change, sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights. As the Population Law, Youth Law, Law on Domestic Violence Prevention and Control, Law on Gender Equality will be developed or revised in the coming years, updated and reliable information on population are thus very critical.\n\nThird, Viet Nam has started its Action Plan for Implementing the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). It is very important for GSO, in collaboration with line ministries, to finalize SDGs statistics indicators, collect and generate these indicators, so that the country’s progress in realizing the 2030 Agenda can be monitored and evaluated.\n\nDistinguished guests,\n\nWithin the framework of the Government of Viet Nam and UN One Strategic Plan (2017-2021), we hope this project, through multi-sectoral coordination, will play a key role in strengthening the capacity of GSO and other partners in collecting, analyzing, disseminating, and utilizing information/data on population, reproductive health and gender, contributing to the implementation and monitoring of the Plan of Action of SDGs.  Building the country's capacity to produce, disseminate and use reliable and accurate data for policy advice and development, for development planning and monitoring SDGs, is indeed a priority for UNFPA and other development partners. I look forward to working closely with all of you effectively.\n\nThank you very much for your attention and participation. I wish you all good health, happiness and success. Merry Christmas and Happy New Year!"}]}

At the outset let me take this opportunity to congratulate the Government of Viet Nam on the progress made in promoting innovation as evidenced by the proposals for the establishment of the National Innovation Center, the World Economic Forum's Center for the Fourth Industrial Revolution and other initiatives.\n\nPromoting inclusive innovation is essential for Viet Nam to pursue rapid, sustainable growth and achieve the Sustainable Development Goals.To quote President Ho Chi Minh Innovation (sáng kiến) is \"the valuable asset of the nation\" - a statement that has become even more relevant with the passage of time. Viet Nam is at a key turning point at which decisions made by government regarding the scale and speed of innovation, how it is generated and diffused, and who benefits, will be critical to the quality of growth and the achievement of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\n\nInstitutions play an important role in the generation and deployment of innovations. Drawing from global experience, we would like to highlight 4 key recommendations:\n\nIn conclusion, Viet Nam has a unique opportunity to design an innovation ecosystem as part of the Socio-Economic Development Strategy that leaves no one behind, especially the most vulnerable people. The production and use of innovation can generate leaps in productivity, reduce poverty and enable communities to respond to increasingly complex environmental and social challenges. The institutions of innovation that government, private sector and communities design now will be help Viet Nam build a resilient, prosperous future that delivers better opportunities for all Vietnamese people.\n\nThe UN stands ready to deepen its support to the Government of Viet Nam and its people in this endeavor."}]}

Women constitute approximately 70 per cent of the 1.3 billion people living on less than US$1 a day, and they tend to be more dependent on common resources such as water, food or wood, and more vulnerable to the impacts of natural resource degradation.\n\nGrowing international debate now highlights the need to move economies and societies onto more sustainable paths, to the \"green economies.\"\n\nGreen economies are being vigorously discussed by governments, businesses and non-governmental organizations alike. According to the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), a green economy is one that results in improved human well-being and social equity, while significantly reducing environmental risks and ecological scarcities; it is low-carbon, resource-efficient and socially inclusive (UNEP, 2011). Green economies will seek to address economic, social and environmental concerns in accordance to sustainable development principles.\n\nA green economy...Is a time of opportunity!\n\nA green economy leads to the expansion of green jobs which do not only minimize negative environmental impacts, but naturally lead to decent jobs since they comply with the ILO standards of decent work.\n\nFor example, in South Africa, a programme to expand public works that included training people to remove invasive alien plants in order to enhance water access, successfully recruited women, youth and people with disabilities to take part in the project.\n\nA green economy, is also a time to challenge gender stereotypes and gender discrimination in the labor market.\n\nIn Bangladesh, as part of a larger project to extend electricity to rural areas by installing solar home systems, women were trained to install and repair solar panels and electrical outlets, serving as \"rural electricians.\"\n\nIn the United States of America, a number of programmes aimed to encourage women into green jobs through skill development and networking, including a programme which gives grants to community-based organizations that provide openings for women into non-traditional occupations, such as technical and engineering jobs, which are the most high-paying occupations in the United States.\n\nAnd, more importantly, a green economy is a time for empowerment!\n\nThis is evident in movements and collectives led by women, to build food and resource independence and sustainable communities and cities.\n\nAn example of this is a network of grass-roots women leaders in South Asia, who scale up capacity to reduce risks and vulnerabilities to climate change in their communities and build a culture of resilience by strengthening the role and voice of women leaders in rural organizations, including in policy dialogue.\n\nHowever, above all, let's not assume that sustainability or a green economy will automatically lead to greater gender equality.\n\nGender equality can have a catalytic effect on achieving economic, social and environmental sustainability, but the opposite does not always hold true.\n\nIn many cases, women are targeted as critical agents for community adaptation to climate change and used as a form of \"sustainability saviours\" in their role as the backbone of sustainable food production. Policies and programmes that view women as sustainability saviours carry dangers for women's own health and well-being, and do not take account of their financial needs or the competing demands on their time. Such approaches are based on the assumption that women's time is an unlimited free resource.\n\nOther policies are based on stereotypical assumptions regarding women's caring role in the family, community and the environment. These policies treat women as homogeneous category without decent consideration about women's different needs, interests, knowledge, values, opportunities and capabilities. They intensify women's workloads to benefit the community and the environment, but can exacerbate gender inequalities.\n\nHence, ladies and gentlemen, it is also a time of challenges.\n\nWe all know that sectors that are targeted for a green economy such as energy, construction and basic industry, are very male dominated. Among green jobs that already exist, women tend to have low representation and occupy the lower value-added levels. Hence, there is a great risk that green industry will not only by pass women, but can actually, potentially marginalize them.\n\nSo, what can we do in this critical time of challenges but also of opportunities?\n\nA gender-responsive green economy that enhances women's employment prospects and the quality of their work along the lines of the decent work agenda is an answer!\n\nIt is now increasingly recognized that a sustainable climate is an important public good. What is not sufficiently recognized is that a sustainable care system is also an important public good.\n\nPresently, much of this care is provided on an unpaid basis. Once care work is decently paid and protected, it can meet the interests of both care workers and users of services. It can also reduce the burden that is placed on women and girls in their role as unpaid carers.\n\nAligning with international frameworks, UN Women Viet Nam country office commits to sustainable development with different programmes on climate change adaptation and green initiatives. For example, green investment in agriculture is potentially very promising given the fact that it is the largest sector in terms of employment in rural areas, where the majority of the world's poor and extremely poor live and work. More importantly, it is where feminization is happening in many countries including Viet Nam.\n\nUnder the programmme \"Strengthening women's livelihoods and participation for greater resilience to disasters and climate change in Viet Nam,\" UN Women is now implementing several livelihood models that follow the safe and environmental friendly approach which, on one hand, can reduce negative impacts on the environment, and on the other hand, strives for improved livelihoods and resilience for vulnerable female farmers who are affected by climate change and disaster risks.\n\nLessons learnt from these livelihood models will contribute to advocate for gender responsive agriculture and rural development policies and strategies.\n\nLadies and gentlemen,\n\nWhile these efforts are instructive and promising, it is important to keep in mind that moving from commitment to action requires political commitment but more importantly, it requires intentional and deliberate efforts, to develop the policies and programmes that allow women to fully engage, participate and benefit from the green economy on equal grounds. Today's forum is one step in the right direction. I look forward to our fruitful discussion and wish you all good health with our greener future."}]}

That important Declaration of 10 December 1948 marked the starting point of the global human rights movement. Together with the UN Charter, the Declaration is also one of the founding documents of the United Nations, which guides the work of the UN in Vietnam. It has been translated into more than 500 languages, including Vietnamese. The words of former UN Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon on the Universal Declaration are particularly relevant to the focus of this Legal Forum which is on poor and vulnerable groups so please allow me to quote him: \"Let us ensure that those people who most need their rights protected are made aware that this Declaration exists — and that it exists for them.\"\n\nBack in 1948 when the Universal Declaration of Human Rights was adopted, the drafters already included in the Declaration the fundamental guarantee that everyone should have the right to a fair and public trial by an independent and impartial tribunal. The Declaration also referred to the principle of presumption of innocence which remains to this day one of the cornerstones of any criminal justice system.\n\nAround the world, as in Vietnam, most of the people who can't enjoy these fundamental rights and guarantees often belong to the poorest and most vulnerable groups, which include victims of gender-based violence, children , persons with disabilities, members of ethnic minorities, LGBTI persons, and so on. For these people, equality before the law can be a distant dream.\n\nThis is often due to the fact that they have limited access to legal information in the first place and are therefore not aware of or have limited understanding of their rights. Legal information may also not be available in a language they understand or in a format that is accessible to them.\n\nIn addition, poor and vulnerable groups often face great challenges in terms of access to legal assistance. Many of them cannot afford the services of a lawyer. Their only option is to try and obtain the services of state lawyers working for the National Legal Aid Agency as in Vietnam. Because of limited resources, not all those who need it can benefit from such legal aid services. The quality of such legal aid lawyers also varies.\n\nWe are fortunate that the Law on Legal Aid in Vietnam was amended last year and has expanded the list of groups of persons who are now eligible for state assisted legal aid.\n\nIt is equally important that the justice system addresses the needs of vulnerable groups. Lawyers, law enforcement officers, judges and prosecutors should receive focused trainings on how to address these needs. For instance, access to justice for minors requires all justice personnel to be adequately trained to provide greater protection to minors as victims, witnesses and offenders.\n\nIn many cases, NGOs who already work with vulnerable groups and are very familiar with their specific needs can make an important contribution in terms of increasing their access to justice. It would be important and useful to build on and increase the synergies between the work of such NGOs and that of the justice agencies.\n\nThe issue of access to justice for poor and vulnerable groups is not just a human rights issue, it is also closely related to the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Just several months ago, on 16 July, Viet Nam presented its Voluntary National Review on SDG implementation to the UN's High Level Political Forum in New York. The key SDG 16 on peace, justice and stronger institutions aims to strengthen the rule of law. One dimension of the rule of law is to ensure equal access to justice for all. Together, we need to ensure that, when it comes to access to justice, no one is left behind. As you know, this is both a central principle and objective of the UN's global 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\n\nTo this end, the UN and the Government of Vietnam, with generous financial support from the European Union, are implementing a new Programme on justice and legal empowerment called EU JULE. As you will hear later this morning, the overall objective of the Programme is to strengthen the rule of law through a more reliable, trusted and better accessed justice system. Through an ambitious set of interventions, we will seek to increase access to justice for women, children and vulnerable groups, including ethnic minorities and poor people to ensure that no one is left behind. This programme will help Viet Nam implement SDG16.\n\nThe EU JULE Programme was launched in October 2018 and activities have started around the country. The first workshop took place in Can Tho last week, co-chaired by Vice-Minister Ngoc and addressing the issue of civil registration for vulnerable groups. There are many more activities, involving not just the Ministry of Justice, but also the Supreme People's Court, the Supreme People's Procuracy and the National Assembly. We look forward to working with many more Vietnamese agencies in the coming months.\n\nTwo UN agencies, namely UNDP and UNICEF, will be drawing on their respective expertise to implement the programme together with the Government and other partners. Both UNDP and UNICEF have a long history of engagement with the Government and people of Viet Nam in the area of justice. Building on this long standing trusted partnership with Viet Nam, we are confident that we can support the Government in delivering high quality and consequential results in order to increase access to justice for poor and vulnerable groups.\n\nThank you!

The climate emergency demands both our attention, as well as our collaboration and innovation. It is imperative that our strategies and actions evolve in a future-facing manner.\n\nThe agenda is driven by two objectives:\n\nFirst, we aim to cultivate stronger and more dynamic partnerships. This involves creating robust channels of communication and collaboration between the DRRP members, the Government of Vietnam, and our partners in the private sector and NGOs. Each of you bring to the table a wealth of experience and expertise that are vital in crafting a comprehensive approach to disaster risk reduction and management.\n\nSecond, we will introduce Ha Long Ministerial Statement on the Strengthening of ASEAN Anticipatory Action in Disaster Management, adopted at the 11th ASEAN Ministerial Meeting on Disaster Management in Vietnam on 12 October 2023.   Central to this Statement are its three foundational building blocks: (1) comprehensive risk information, forecasting, and early warning systems; (2) strategic planning and efficient operations; and (3) pre-arranged financing. Each of these elements plays a vital role in fortifying ASEAN's anticipatory action for disaster management.\n\nWe are particularly honored by the presence of former Minister, His Excellency Mr. Cao Duc Phat, President of the Community Disaster Prevention and Control Fund, VDMA Director General Pham Duc Luan, representatives from the Vietnam Chamber of Commerce and Industry, as well as partners from NGOs and the private sector. Your participation enriches our discussion and underscores the importance of a unified and whole-of-society approach in tackling the challenges ahead.\n\nDistinguished guests,\n\nEarly action and preparedness can significantly mitigate the impact of natural disasters. As was the case in Bangladesh in 2020, for instance, anticipatory flood management strategies have shown remarkable success in reducing both economic losses and human casualties. Collective anticipatory action at scale is possible and works. In Bangladesh, more people were reached earlier, faster, and at half the cost of a comparable rapid response[1].\n\nAs we move into our panel discussions, I encourage every one of you to actively share your ideas, experiences, and perspectives. Your contributions are key to improving our approaches and strategies. Our shared knowledge, commitment, and collaboration contribute to a nation that can stand strong against the inevitable challenges posed by worsening natural disasters. Together, we continue our journey towards a future where Vietnam is not only prepared for disasters but is also resilient in the face of them.\n\nThank you for your active engagement!

The government has moved from being an aid recipient to co-leading the OSP formulation and jointly owning this key and strategic partnership document. I would like to acknowledge the Government's efforts, led by MPI as the coordinating agency, in taking national ownership and working towards Vietnam's national development priorities. In my meeting with the Director General of FERD/MPI, Mr. Khanh in May, we agreed to the formation of a Joint Working Group to explore additional resource mobilization for the OSP, including through government co-financing. The OSP has an ambitious resource envelope of USD 423 million over the five-year period 2017-2021, of which 40% has been mobilized so far.\n\nThe One Strategic Plan is SDG-centric and based on the three principles of inclusion, equity and sustainability. It echoes the Agenda 2030 Sustainable Development Goal theme of leaving no one behind. It represents the programmatic framework for 14 resident and 4 non-resident UN agencies working in Viet Nam, fully responds to Viet Nam's Lower Middle Income country development context and at the same time takes into account Viet Nam's broader regional and global aspirations. The OSP benefited from extensive consultation with the Government, development partners and other stakeholders. I wish to thank all stakeholders who contributed to its formulation process and substantive content.\n\nOn this occasion, I would also like to thank all of you and some other UN and other colleagues who are not here today for your and their considerable efforts, time and commitment as well as for your and their comments and feedback into both the formulation process and substance and content of the document. We look forward to your and their continued support, partnership and further engagement in the implementation of this OSP over the next five years.\n\nThis partnership document is structured around four focus areas, shaped by the central themes of the SDGs (People, Planet, Prosperity and Peace) and emphasizes nine related outcomes. Additionally, five critical cross-cutting themes have been identified: Gender Equality; Human Rights; Participation; Data for Development; and Partnership and Innovation. Through the new OSP, the UN will continue to build on its comparative advantages in providing Viet Nam with integrated solutions to complex multidimensional development challenges by drawing on collective regional and global knowledge; supporting a normative voice on human rights and freedom of speech and association, prioritizing equity and citizen-centered reforms; and strengthening South-South cooperation.\n\nAlthough the implementation of the OSP has been delayed as a result of the delay in OSP signing, I am confident that with the continued partnership and cooperation of the Government, our developments partners and key stakeholders, and the firm commitment of the UN Country Team, we will be able to expedite the implementation of the OSP and contribute significantly to Viet Nam's development progress.\n\nTo help facilitate this, I call on the Government's support to enable the simplification and harmonization of business management processes to facilitate effective implementation for efficient and quality programmatic results.\n\nI am happy today to reaffirm the UN's commitment to Viet Nam's implementation of the global Blueprint for Action of which Viet Nam is a part – this is an initiative of the UNSG's Special Representatives on EL Nino and Climate Change, which the Government of Viet Nam recently accepted to join as one of ten global pilot countries.\n\n2017 also marks 40 years of the UN – Viet Nam partnership and as we celebrate our joint achievements and successes over the last four decades, we must note that these successes and achievements raise ambitious expectations for the future. The Government's aspiration to become an upper middle-income country requires concerted efforts in governance including human rights - Goal 16 of the SDGs - as well as achievement of the other SDGs through the Government's National Action Plan on the SDGs which will soon be launched. Through the continued support of all partners represented in this room today, I am confident that these expectations will bear fruit for the benefit of Viet Nam and its people.\n\nViet Nam is in the forefront of UN reform as it was not only one of the first amongst the original pilots but is still one of the top performing countries of the Delivering as One (DaO) UN Initiative, both programmatically and operationally. Vietnam will continue to be looked upon as a premier learning and experimenting hub on DaO with important lessons to be shared given the decade long experience in DaO and new momentum focused on new innovations to be implemented before these are also shared with other countries around the world. Globally, at least 57 countries have now taken the DaO road, with Viet Nam still in the forefront.\n\nI would like to reiterate my personal commitment to taking the success of the One UN Initiative in Vietnam to the next stage – this has implications well beyond Viet Nam and will also be key for UN reform to succeed globally. I also commit to providing leadership to ensure that the 18 UN agencies which are partners in the One Strategic Plan 2017-2021 contribute as best as we can together to Vietnam's future development.\n\nAllow me to conclude by emphasizing that this week is an unique and very special week for the UN in the Agenda 2030 context. The Government is going to launch Viet Nam's National Action Plan for implementation of the 2030 Agenda at a workshop chaired by H.E, DPM Vu Duc Dam on 7 July. I am very honoured to have been invited to deliver the UN's remarks there which reaffirm the UN's readiness to partner with the Government of Viet Nam and other stakeholders in supporting Viet Nam's efforts in implementing the Action Plan and realizing the SDGs. And now, today, in the same week, I am signing the OSP 2017-2021 to put the UN's commitment in Viet Nam on the SDGs into action!\n\nI would like to thank all of you for your cooperation and continued support and wish you all the very best of health, happiness and success!\n\nXin cam on."}]}

Senior Lieutenant General Nguyen Chi Vinh, Deputy Defence Minister of Viet Nam\n\nH.E. Mr. Norihiro Nakayama, Parliamentary Vice-Minister for Foreign Affairs of Japan\n\nExcellencies, Distinguished Delegates, Ladies and Gentlemen,\n\nGood morning.\n\nI would like to begin by welcoming the trainees from Bhutan, Cambodia, Indonesia, Nepal and Viet Nam and our trainers and interpreters from Japan to the UN Triangular Partnership Project Heavy Engineering Training of Trainers course. May I also express the United Nations’ sincere appreciation to the Government of Viet Nam for hosting the training, and to the Japanese Parliamentary Vice-Minister and his delegation for visiting us amidst your busy schedule.\n\nI am pleased to join you at this opening ceremony and to give a few remarks on behalf of the United Nations.\n\nDistinguished Delegates,\n\nToday’s peacekeeping environment from Mali to the Central African Republic and from the Democratic Republic of Congo to South Sudan requires a range of strengthened capabilities. Where UN peace-keeping operations are active, high-quality enabling units in engineering and medical areas are increasingly in demand.\n\nThe Triangular Partnership Project was announced at the first Summit on UN Peacekeeping in September 2014. With Japan’s generous support through both funding and trainers, the Project had launched its first trial training in Heavy Engineering Equipment operations in Nairobi, Kenya by 2015.\n\nSince then, with the support of partner Member States and hosts of the training including Brazil, Israel, Japan, Kenya, Rwanda, Switzerland, Uganda and Viet Nam, the Project has grown every year, and has so far trained 458 military engineers from 23 African and Asia-Pacific countries and 29 field medics.\n\nOf these, many of the graduates have already deployed to peace operations such as MONUSCO (DRC), UNMISS (South Sudan), AMISOM (Somalia), MINUSMA (Mali) and UNIFIL (Lebanon). The Training-of-Trainers graduates of the Project are imparting further training in their home countries.\n\nThe United Nations is very pleased with the success of the Project to date. It would not have been possible without the strong support of partner Member States, our hosts of the training, the credibility that the Project has built, and the excellent performance of all the trainers and trainees who are part of the Project.\n\nLadies and Gentlemen,\n\nThe triangular partnership model is increasingly being recognized in important fora and by key stakeholders as an effective mechanism to strengthen UN peacekeeping.\n\nThe Declaration of Shared Commitments on UN Peacekeeping Operations which was endorsed by over 150 UN Member States describes triangular partnerships as an innovative approach to training and equipping uniformed personnel. The UN Department of Operational Support (DOS) has made notable progress in strengthening peacekeeping capabilities in the engineering and medical fieldsthrough the Triangular Partnership Project, which brings together the United Nations, Member States with expertise and resources, and the Troop Contributing Countries.\n\nOn 30 January this year, at a briefing in the UN Security Council during Viet Nam’s UN Security Council Presidency on ‘Cooperation between the UN and regional and sub-regional organisations in maintaining international peace and security: the role of ASEAN’, the UN Secretary-General spoke about the Triangular Partnership Project, and thanked Viet Nam, along with Indonesia, Thailand and Cambodia, for hosting the training courses on a rotational basis.\n\nI am pleased to open our third training in Hanoi as a ‘Training-of-Trainers’ programme. Since I became the UN Resident Coordinator in Viet Nam in early 2017, the UN in Viet Nam has significantly and visibly increased its commitment to supporting Viet Nam’s efforts in increasing deployments to UN peacekeeping operations. In November 2018, UNDP organized an important conference on Viet Nam’s role in UN peacekeeping efforts and helped develop a discussion paper on Viet Nam’s long-term peacekeeping strategy together with the UN’s Department of Peacekeeping Operations and the Department of Field Support, which have now been renamed as the Department of Peace Operations and the Department of Operational Support, respectively.\n\nThe training which starts today builds on the success of the engineering and medical training conducted in Africa, including in Kenya, Rwanda and Uganda, and the engineering training in Viet Nam in 2018 and again late last year.\n\nThe course objective is to provide trainees with the skills to instruct others in the operation of core Heavy Engineering Equipment such as bulldozers, motor graders, hydraulic excavators, bucket loaders and self-propelled vibratory rollers - in the execution of basic horizontal engineering tasks. This is expected to enhance local ownership and sustainability of the skills acquired.\n\nSome of you, who perform exceptionally well, may be asked to participate as trainers and mentors in future United Nations Triangular Partnership engineering training courses.\n\nExcellencies Deputy Defence Minister and Vice Minister for Foreign Affairs of Japan, and Distinguished Delegates,\n\nAllow me to conclude by once again expressing my sincere gratitude to Viet Nam forhosting this course and Japan for making available its trainers, interpreters and a liaison officer.\n\nDeploying forces that meet our operational standards is a critical component of filling peacekeeping capability gaps. This begins with proper skills training and a robust equipment profile.\n\nThese are the capabilities that this Project aims to help build with your continuing strong support and active participation.\n\nBest wishes to you all for a successful and productive training.\n\nThank you! Xin cảm ơn!"}]}

We look forward to working closely with all of you for the project implementation. Without addressing the issue of violence against women and children, there is no way that the Sustainable Development Goals can be achieved.\n\nLadies and gentlemen,\n\nViolence against women and children is one of the most pervasive human rights violations that exist in many countries in the world. Violence against women and children may occur in a multitude of different contexts, including home, workplace, public and social spaces. It is estimated that 35.6% of women, globally, have experienced either physical or sexual intimate partner violence, or sexual violence by non-partner, or both at some point in their lives.\n\nSadly, Viet Nam is no exception.\n\nThe National Study on Domestic Violence against Women in Viet Nam, conducted by the General Statistics Office in 2010, showed that 58% of ever-married women had experienced at least one of the three forms of violence (physical, sexual or psychological) in their lifetime.\n\nHowever, 87% of survivors – that’s almost 9 out of 10 women - did not seek help from any authorities due to lack of available services or because of the fear of stigma, discrimination and further harassment.\n\nViolence against children is widespread in Viet Nam as well. According to the Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey in 2014, around two out of three children aged 1-14 years experienced some forms of violent discipline in the home. In addition, the Government of Viet Nam reports over 2,000 cases of child abuse every year, of which 75% are of sexual abuse. However, that is considered to be only the tip of the iceberg, alluding to a much more complex and widespread reality.\n\nDistinguished guests,\n\nIt has been reported that the pre-existing crisis of violence against women and children has been exacerbated in the context of COVID-19 globally, and Viet Nam is following the same trend. Recent reports in relation to COVID-19 have shown that restrictions in movement, social isolation and similar containment measures, coupled with existing or increased social and economic pressures and stress on families, have led to an increase in violence, particularly against women and children. In many countries it is estimated that domestic violence has increased by at least 30%.\n\nIn Viet Nam, the Peace House Hotline (a shelter run by the Viet Nam Women’s Union) has received twice as many calls for help over the past months compared to the same months in previous years. The Sunshine Hotline (as supported by UNFPA in Quang Ninh province) also received many calls during social distancing period. It has been reported that risks of physical abuse, sexual abuse and child sexual abuse and exploitation have increased substantially.\n\nLadies and gentlemen,\n\nWithin the current context, the project we are launching today shows a great cooperation between the Government of Australia, the Government of Viet Nam, and the UN agencies in continuing to address the challenges ahead on violence against women and children in Viet Nam.\n\nEnding violence against women and children should be a priority for everyone. It is about making sure that everyone is part of the country’s sustainable development process, leaving no one behind. We trust that this new project will make a great leap forward to eliminate violence against women, girls and boys in Viet Nam.\n\nThank you very much for your attention and participation."}]}

And, it is more than just essential to quench our thirst and protect our health, but also vital for creating jobs and supporting economic, social and human development. In the world today, it is estimated that there are over 660 million people who live without a safe water supply close to home, spending countless hours queuing or walking to distant sources. In addition, the world's population must cope with the effects of health impacts of using contaminated water, which affected more than 3.7 billion people between 1995 and 2016, causing around 840,000 deaths each year. The combined impacts of population and economic growth, changing social behaviour, environmental damage, climate variability and water-related disasters culminate in an ever more challenging horizon for water, especially in Viet Nam.\n\nSustainable Development Goal 6 \"Ensuring the availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all by 2030\" focuses on achieving universal and equitable access to safe and affordable drinking water as well as sanitation and hygiene, improving water quality by reducing pollution, increasing water-use efficiency across all economic sectors, and protecting water-related ecosystems – all challenges we can only successfully address together.\n\nClimate change scenarios and models of water cycle dynamics show that the discrepancy between water supply and demand will become increasingly critical in the coming years. The frequency and severity of floods and droughts will likely change in many regions worldwide, with significant socio-economic and environmental consequences. Viet Nam, one of the most climate vulnerable countries globally, experienced the worst drought and salt water intrusion crisis in over 60 years in 2016, and in 2017 had to respond to one of the worst recorded storm and flood seasons. The impacts of climate change and water scarcity have also exacerbated the existing trends in rural to urban migration in Viet Nam, as natural disasters make natural resource-based livelihoods more tenuous.\n\nDistinguished guests,\n\nWater plays a crucial role in the economic development of Viet Nam, especially in agriculture, aquaculture and industry but also in support of its citizens' livelihoods, their health and wellbeing.\n\nAt the same time, economic development and population growth, together with climate change, contribute to water-related pressures. Demand for the use of water continues to increase, in production systems and for people. At the same time water is also a channel for pollution through the release of waste water. While 91% of the Vietnamese population have access to clean drinking water, this still leaves more than 4.5 million people in this country without direct access to safe water sources. As a result, the UN, in cooperation with the Government of Viet Nam and water supply companies, developed plans for water treatment, safe storage and water security, aiming for a fully functioning distribution system that will allow access to safe water resources by the entire population. While the Government has made such plans mandatory, enforcement is weak and supplier activities are not always coordinated. If current trends persist, water quality in Viet Nam will continue to degrade over the coming decades, further endangering human health and ecosystems, contributing to water scarcity and constraining sustainable development.\n\nIn addition, Viet Nam's fast-paced economic development is leading to a continued loss and degradation of health and natural ecosystems, especially forests, free-flowing rivers and natural wetlands which are being converted for or impacted by commercial agriculture and aquaculture, industrial parks and urbanization.\n\nBy strengthening the country's natural infrastructure, using nature-based solutions, important beneficial services for people can be maintained. For example, Viet Nam's forests play an important role in water regulation, replenishing groundwater and ensuring sufficiency of water supply downstream, while reducing soil erosion and flood risks. Along the coast, natural wetlands are important to moderate the impact of extreme events, acting as a natural buffer against the impact of typhoons and storm surges, providing protection to people and development investments. Both inland and along the coast, natural ecosystems contribute to maintaining water quality, purification, and erosion control. It is widely acknowledged that maintaining such green infrastructure is more cost-effective than man-made solutions. At the same time, natural ecosystems are of key importance to support Viet Nam's valuable biodiversity, including many globally threatened as well as unique endemic species.\n\nPlease allow me to conclude by saying that the UN in Viet Nam remains strongly committed to helping Viet Nam strengthen inclusive socio-economic development through the adoption of appropriate solutions for the sustainable use and conservation of its natural resources and valuable biodiversity, for the benefit of all its citizens and the environment. By promoting the conservation, sustainable use and restoration of natural ecosystems, the UN can help Viet Nam meet the needs of its people for sufficient water of reliable quality, while also supporting the protection of its environment. In this manner it will contribute to a multitude of SDG goals, including poverty reduction, improved health, access to water and sanitation, sustainable cities, life below water, and life on land. I hope that fruitful discussions will be held at this forum, which will enable us to enhance our collective efforts and outcomes.\n\nXin Cảm Ơn!"}]}

Mr. Vuong Dinh Hue, Member of the Politburo, Deputy Prime Minister of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam, Chairman of the Central Steering Committee for the 2019 Population and Housing Census,\n\nHonorable Mr. Nguyen Chi Dung, Minister of Planning and Investment, Permanent Vice-Chairman of the Central Steering Committee for the 2009 Population and Housing Census,\n\nMr. Nguyen Bich Lam, Director General, General Statistics Office (GSO), Vice Chairman of the Central Steering Committee on 2019 Population and Housing Census Steering Committee,\n\nMembers of the Central Census Steering Committee,\n\nRepresentatives of the Central Committee for Popularization and Education (CCPE), National Assembly, Office of the Central Party Committee, Office of the President, Office of the Government,\n\nRepresentatives of the Ministry of Planning and Investment, line Ministries,\n\nRepresentatives of the Provincial/City Steering Committees on 2019 Population and Housing Census,\n\nMedia, Development Partners, and UN colleagues,\n\nLadies and Gentlemen,\n\nI am very pleased to be here today at this landmark conference organized by the Central Census Steering Committee to disseminate the results of the 2019 Population and Housing Census. This is an extremely important event, given the high values of the Census data for the nation – which is to develop and monitor policies, plans, programmes, and budgets at both central and local levels – and for the international community more broadly – to understand Viet Nam’s progress and areas needed for international support, including the realization of the 2030 Agenda on Sustainable Development.  Census is a colossal undertaking of national statistics that happens only once in every ten years; thus today the whole country is in suspense to hearing what the Census data can tell. In just a week, we will have the Viet Nam Population Day (26 December), and the 2019 Census is one of the greatest achievements to celebrate that commemoration. I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate you all for the success of the 2019 Census.\n\nI arrived in Viet Nam with an honor assignment as UNFPA Representative for Viet Nam three months ago, when Viet Nam just disseminated the 2019 Census preliminary results. I have learnt of the GSO’s bold initiative to apply Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in all the census phases, especially the use of electronic devices for data enumeration that has helped improve substantially the quality and transparency of data collected, shorten the time for data processing, minimize human errors, and disseminate census results early.  UNFPA is impressed with the remarkable progress achieved by Viet Nam in this area, and we are very happy to have been part of this data revolution.\n\nIndeed, the success of the Census is also counted on the commitment and efforts of the entire political system, including considerable resources mobilized, the tireless efforts of the Census Steering Committees at all levels, of nearly 147 thousands of enumerators, team leaders and supervisors, but most importantly, on the active participation of the Vietnamese people themselves. The success of the 2019 Census provides a further track record of the Government’s impressive capacity to coordinate and conduct the Population and Housing Census as well as other large-scale population-based surveys.\n\nLadies and Gentlemen,\n\nAs we have seen the Census Results from the presentation of Mr. Nguyen Bich Lam, the Census provides key indicators of population and housing, allowing us to see not only disaggregated data of population size and structure, but also other areas of population dynamics such as fertility, mortality, migration, education, employment, disability, and housing conditions. The Census results firmly confirm that Viet Nam’s fertility rate has been steadily and slightly under the replacement level at 2.09 children per woman at present. This indeed assures the current and ongoing consideration for recasting by the Government of Viet Nam on population work, from population and family planning in the past, to population and development for 2030 SDGs agenda.\n\nThe Census results show that Viet Nam is still in the period of demographic transition, providing a “demographic window of opportunity” when the number of working-age population doubles the number of those of dependent ages. This presents a great opportunity for socio-economic advancement if appropriate policies are in place for human development, especially for young people, decent job creation, sexual and reproductive health and rights, and gender equality. At the same time, we do need to underline that demographic transition, particularly fertility decline means that Viet Nam’s population is aging at a pace never seen before, with aging index growing from 35.9% in 2009 to 48.8% in 2019. Therefore, while taking advantage of the demographic bonus, the country should also be ready to address the challenges of population ageing. I would like to stress further that having a large proportion of older people is not all negative, but it is an opportunity. The rise of life expectancy at birth from 75.6 to 76.3 for female and from 70.2 to 71 for male during last 10 years has demonstrated achievements of our health and social development programmes. Older people, especially the younger old, continue to be precious, resourceful, and experienced human resources continuing to contribute to the country’s economic and social growth. Equally important, older people are the cultural asset that necessarily links up the past, the present and the future of the country. Ageing society can also mean the opportunity for the development of an industry to meet the needs of the elderly, including the provision of care for older persons in the health sector and beyond. In the context of Viet Nam’s accelerating Industrial Revolution 4.0, we have ample opportunities for everybody, young and old to advance, making sure that “no one is left behind”.\n\nThe Census results show progress in maternal and child care services in Viet Nam, with the proportion of births attended by skilled health personnel is 95.4%.  The maternal mortality ratio in 2019 is 46 maternal deaths per 100 000 live births, which is a decrease by one-third, compared to 2009 (69 maternal deaths per 100 000 live births) indicating that Viet Nam will achieve its goal of reducing maternal mortality earlier than the plan stated in the National Action Plan for Agenda 2030.\n\nHowever, one challenge that has not improved is the unbalanced sex ratio at birth (SRB). It is estimated at 111.5 boys per 100 girls in 2019, and this is still a lot higher than the level which is naturally and biologically possible, which is at around 105. It is strongly suspected that this demographic imbalance is a result of pre-natal sex selection largely based on son preference, which is deeply rooted in the traditional culture in many countries in the world including Viet Nam. Gender-based sex selection should be stopped from the perspectives of gender equality, and also the unbalanced sex ratio can soon have implications for the population’s marital status and a further fertility decline. As such, more intensified nation-wide efforts have to be called for, for the implementation of existing legal and policy frameworks to prevent gender-based sex selection and in promotion for gender equality at large.\n\nLadies and Gentlemen,\n\nUNFPA has a long history of successful cooperation with the GSO in undertaking population and housing censuses, starting with the very first Census in 1979.  Within the current framework of UNFPA Country Programme for the period 2017-2021, UNFPA commits to supporting the GSO in not only carrying out this Census successfully, but also in producing and disseminating Census results, as well as in ensuring good use of quality Census data for the country’s policy and decision-making, so that we can make a difference for better lives of all the people.  Today, I am truly delighted to announce that the photo voice exhibition titled \"Stories behind the data\" is launched as well, in connection with the 2019 census result dissemination. We would like to thank all of the photographers for the beautiful photos and stories they collected from nine cities and provinces in Viet Nam with regard to the Census. We would also like to thank the Vietnamese families who participated in this photo voice project and shared their inspiring stories that really touched our hearts. It is meant to enhance the understanding of key issues behind the Census data, make a real contribution to improving the lives of Vietnamese people, and ensure that no one is left behind in Viet Nam’s development process.\n\nI wish you all every success in the dissemination of the Census results today and beyond, towards a Viet Nam where every pregnancy is wanted, every child birth is safe, and every young person’s potential is fulfilled.\n\nXim Cam On."}]}

Let me start by commending the government of Viet Nam, and especially the Vietnam Women’s Union, for its commitment to review and strengthen implementation so as to achieve the gender equality and women’s empowerment goal and its targets as an essential dimension of the sustainable development of Viet Nam, especially in the recovery and post-COVID-19 period.\n\nToday, we are together commemorating the 111th Anniversary of International Women’s Day with this year’s theme being: “Women in leadership: Achieving an equal future in a COVID-19 world”, to recognize the tremendous efforts by women and girls around the world in shaping a more equal future both during the pandemic and now as recovery phase begins.\n\nThe International Women’s Day theme is also aligned with the priority of the 65th session of the Commission on the Status of Women, which calls for “Women's full and effective participation and decision-making in public life, as well as the elimination of violence, for achieving gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls”.\n\nCOVID-19 pandemic recovery efforts require an acceleration in progress in the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) since the pandemic has resulted in a significant backslide in many important goals and indicators. Recovery efforts also provide an opportunity to build forward better. Recognizing the importance of gender equality as a goal in itself, and at the same time, as a cross cutting component necessary for the achievement of all other SDGs, requires us to understand the different needs and impacts on women and girls, and on men and boys, for all socio-economic and environmental development interventions. Addressing gender differences and existing gender gaps, will increase the effectiveness and efficiency of the post-covid socio-economic recovery policies and get countries on track towards achieving the 2030 agenda for Sustainable Development, ensuring that No One is Left Behind.\n\nLadies and gentlemen,\n\nAllow me to now highlight an overreaching issue become more effective. Women remain significantly underrepresented in all aspects of decision-making, threatening overall sustainable development. Women’s perspectives and solutions remain severely underrepresented, for example, only 3.5% of the COVID-19 task forces in 87 countries had gender parity!!! Good governance represented by SDG Goal 16 requires inclusive and effective participation as well as equal opportunities for leadership of women at all levels of decision-making in political, economic and public life. The current pace of progress in this area is too slow and failure to increase women’s role in strategic decisions will make it impossible to achieve the targets of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\n\nGender balance would also be achieved more quickly if more leaders show the political will to set and meet parity targets for all executive, legislative, and judiciary positions at all levels. When women are not consulted or included in decision-making on issues that have a direct impact on their lives - such as education, health, economic development and conflict resolution, policy outcomes risk being ineffective, harmful or could even lead to the violation of women’s rights.\n\nThe recognition of these deficiencies by the 25-year review of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action has ignited a global movement that will take expression in a Generation Equality Forum taking place in Mexico and France, in March and June, respectively, this year. During the Forum, 6 global Action Coalitions will be launched in an effort to accelerate funding and action by multiple stakeholders, especially youth, spearheading: greater women’s right to decision-making in all areas of life; equal pay; equal sharing of unpaid care and domestic work; ending all forms of violence against women and girls; and sexual and reproductive health-care services that respond to women’s needs. Viet Nam can join these efforts and be a key player in the collective action to transform institutions, systems and practices.\n\nDistinguished Guests,\n\nExisting gender inequalities have been exacerbated by the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic worldwide. COVID-19 has made evident the need for a gender-sensitive response, informed by sex-disaggregated data, research, and analysis. According to UN Women’s global study on gender, COVID-19 and SDGs, we have seen four significant negative global gender impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on women:\n\nFirst, the rise in gender-based and domestic violence during lockdowns. For many women and girls, their home is not a safe space, and emerging data suggests that it has become less safe since the outbreak of COVID-19. Restrictions on movements and limited privacy due to isolation measures during the pandemic have meant that many women are unable to phone for help or receive support from their social networks, exponentially increasing the risk of gender-based violence, converting the COVID-19 pandemic into what the UN Secretary General and other experts have referred to as the “shadow pandemic\".\n\nSecond, the risk of reversing decades of progress in the fight against poverty. Women typically earn less and hold less secure jobs than men. With economic activity having literally come to a standstill in much of the world during the pandemic, women working in the informal sector have seen a dramatic decline in their capacity to earn a living. The same UN Women study estimated that during the first months of the crisis informal workers globally lost an average of 60 per cent of their income. The drop was 22 per cent in Asia and the Pacific.\n\nThird, there has been an increase in the burden of unpaid care and domestic work on women. Before the pandemic, women globally already did nearly three times as much unpaid care and domestic work as men.During COVID-19 in 2020 working women did 15 hours more a week of unpaid care and domestic work compared to men.\n\nAnd fourth, there has been an increase in the gender divide in access to technology and information. While digital technologies facilitated business continuity in some sectors and connected people through social media, almost half of the world’s population — 3.6 billion people — remains offline, mostly poorer countries. Data from several countries – including Bangladesh and Pakistan, point to an expansion in the gender divide in access to technology and information during COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nHere in Viet Nam, we – the United Nations in Viet Nam - have worked closely with the government, private sector and civil society organizations to conduct rapid assessments to collect and analyze data on the impact of COVID-19 on gender equality and the empowerment of women. Allow me to highlight some of our findings:\n\nWe collected evidence to show that GBV has increased for women and children due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. UN Women, UNFPA, and UNICEF worked closely with the government and the Vietnamese Women’s Union’ Center for Women’s Development (CWD) to address this issue. During the period of strict physical distancing in April 2020, calls to the Peace House hotline and the number of women reaching out to services and shelters doubled compared with the same period in the prior year (2019) and continued to increase cumulatively to equal seven times during the year (compared to 2019 data).\n\nAccording to a new policy analysis on Gender and the Labour Market in Viet Nam by ILO based on the General Statistics Office’s data, the COVID-19 crisis has generated a gap in unemployment which disadvantages women, which was not there before the pandemic. More specifically, Viet Nam’s workers faced a severe reduction in working hours during the second quarter of this year, especially women.  In the third quarter of 2020, with economic activity starting up again and schools reopening, women and men increased their working hours, possibly to make up for lost income. Women on average added more hours than men, which was positive but it also exacerbated their double burden.\n\nA CARE’s rapid gender analysis in Viet Nam from 2020 showed that the impact of the pandemic has caused many people to slip back into poverty. Especially in rural areas and ethnic minority communities, people struggle with unemployment, underemployment and loss of income. Women who operate micro, small and informal enterprises are also amongst the hardest hit.\n\nLadies and gentlemen,\n\nWe need to work jointly to generate the catalytic and multiplier effects that gender equality can have on the achievement of all the 17 SDGs and the 2030 Agenda, especially in terms of leaving no one behind. As part of the COVID-19 Socio-Economic Response Plan for UN in Viet Nam, we conducted a level mapping of gender-responsiveness of our own interventions, including specific actions to address gender inequality issues.\n\nI am glad to share with you that together, the UN in Vietnam as a whole invested more than 30% of its COVID-19 response budget in 2020 on addressing gender inequality issues that were exacerbated the pandemic. Special Priority was given, as an essential part of our COVID-19 response, to ending violence against women and ensuring that all women and children in Viet Nam, including those most vulnerable, live a life free of violence.\n\nStill, there is much work left to be done to tackle the unfulfilled gender and other aspirations of the SDGs, including the urgent need to conduct a gender analysis of Viet Nam’s COVID-19 recovery package to ensure that it addresses new and exacerbated gender inequality issues that have emerged as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nOf the many recommendations made by the UN Secretary-General to the Commission on the Status of Women, please allow me to highlight some that I believe are most relevant to the Vietnamese context:\n\nSetting ambitious targets and action plans striving for gender parity (50%), including quota for women’s participation and leadership in all levels of Government.\n\nMaking available additional resources for women’s political participation.\n\nActively countering social norms that reinforce the societal bias against women in leadership and hinder their full and effective participation in public life.\n\nCriminalizing all violence against women in public life, ensuring effectiveness of complaints and reporting mechanisms, and building capacity of law enforcement personnel. In this context, Codes of Conduct in the public and private sector should indicate zero tolerance for such violence.\n\nExcellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen\n\nAll UN Member States and Governments can facilitate a more inclusive and enabling environment in which all women can participate equally in public life. More ambitious targets increased political will, sustainable financing and gender-responsive institutional arrangements are all necessary ingredients for such an approach. As Viet Nam has always professed that it is keen to advance gender equality in the Asia and the Pacific region, Viet Nam should show leadership in promoting gender equality in a post-COVID-19 world. The United Nations stands ready to continue to support the people and the government of Viet Nam in this important endeavor.\n\nThank you!Xin Cam on!"}]}

(Hello everyone in Vietnamese)\n\nI am very pleased to participate in today's Forum entitled \"The Journey to Age Equality\" to mark the International Day of Older Persons, which is celebrated across the world on 1 October.\n\nLet me at the outset thank the Viet Nam Association of the Elderly, the General Office for Population and Family Planning, and HelpAge for co-hosting today's Forum, which is to raise awareness of how vital older people are as a part of the community and to promote their equality and inclusiveness in society. And today we mark this day with the theme of \"The Journey to Age Equality \".\n\nDistinguished guests,\n\nWe are all getting older. This is a fact of life.\n\nGetting older is awesome - because we get more experience and wisdom.\n\nPopulation ageing is one of the most significant trends and features of the 21st century particularly in Viet Nam and in the Asia and the Pacific region. Globally, one in nine persons is aged 60 or older, and this is projected to increase to one in five by 2050. Between 2015 and 2030, it is estimated that the number of older persons worldwide is set to increase by 56 per cent—from 901 million to more than 1.4 billion. By 2030, the number of people aged 60 and above will exceed those aged 15 and 24. In Viet Nam, the proportion of older persons in the total population has increased to 11.9 per cent in 2017, and will be doubled to 20 per cent by 2038.\n\nAnd therefore, population ageing is not the subject to be ignored in the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda. Population ageing happens not because of mortality decline, or because people live longer, but because fertility declines. All countries in the world including Viet Nam must be prepared for aging when couples start to have a smaller family. Viet Nam must envision a new paradigm that aligns demographic ageing with economic and social growth and ensure social inclusion of the elderly.\n\nAgeing is a triumph of development. We must now turn our focus from merely helping people reach old age to helping them reach a productive old age continuing to contribute to the development of the society and the country.\n\nLadies and gentlemen,\n\nOur today's event aims to raise awareness about ageing population and to facilitate inter-generational discussions on experiences, lessons learned and progress on the journey to ending older age inequality and changing negative narratives and stereotypes involving \"older age\".\n\nDistinguished guests,\n\nThe year 2019 is indeed a special year, as we mark the 25 year anniversary of the adoption of the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development. As such, today we open the photo voice exhibition called \"Humans of ICPD: Across the life cycle: Right and Choice for All People\". It showcases two sets of photos: one set with 15 photos of 15 ICPD Principles that represent the interrelationships between population and sustainable development. And another set of photos with 15 inspiring stories of older persons in different parts of the country. Through the voices of older persons, a message must be spread, and movement needs to be created, to say that older persons are an active participant in the society, not a burden to the society. In that sense, it is extremely important that Viet Nam should facilitate employment opportunities, flexible and equal retirement age between men and women, and skills development for older persons as a means to ensure income and benefits for old age.\n\nAs we step towards the better future we all want, 'leaving no one behind,' let us promote equality and ensure the full participation of older persons to build a better society for all ages.\n\nThank you, and wishing you all health, happiness and success on the occasion of the International Day of Older Persons.\n\nXin cam on (Thank you in Vietnamese)"}]}

Stock exchanges around the world celebrate International Women’s Day by highlighting the pivotal role of the private sector, especially the capital markets in advancing gender equality.\n\nThis year’s international women’s daywill be celebrated with mixed emotions. While we celebrate the progress women have made across the globe, we are also pained by the regression caused by wars, climate disasters and persisting discrimination against women. When Member States gathered in September 2023 at the SDG Summit, there was one clear message: the Sustainable Development Goals are off track and require a rescue plan. At the current pace of progress, we will require140 yearsto achieve equal representation in leadership in the workplace.\n\nSo it is befitting thatthe theme for this year’s IWD is, Invest in women: accelerate progress. Investment in women’s empowerment and gender equality is a powerful catalyst for accelerating business development, innovation and entrepreneurship, as well as diversifying consumer markets and creating inclusive societies.\n\nIn today’s event, we have leaders who are making conscious decisions to invest in women and in gender equality through applying UN Women’s Women Empowerment Principles.I applaud the 181 companies that have signed up to the Women’s Empowerment Principles in Vietnam. We have seen a steady increase of new WEPs signatories among listed and security companies. To name a few: PNJ, BRG, Safoco, Viet Thang Garment, Garment no.10, Dien Quang Lamp, PAN Group, TH Group, BIDV, VPS Securities, Alphanam and Vietnam Airlines. I also congratulate the WEP awardees in 2020 to 2022: PNJ, BRG, PAN Group, TH Group, Garment no.10, VPS Securities.\n\nYou inspire our dreams of a world where women and men equally thrive.\n\nWhile we celebrate this growth in private sector engagements,we ring the bell to call attentionto 4 concerns:\n\nFirst, women are still paid less than men for the same work.In Vietnam women are paid 77% of what men are paid for the same work.\n\nSecond, few women are participating in decision making. 53% of companies listed on the Stock Exchange have at least one women on the board; 31% of listed companies only have one woman on the board and only 2% companies have an equal number of women and men on the board.\n\nThird, women spend twice as many hours as men on unpaid care work.\n\nFourth, while women’s owned businessaccount for 20% of the total number of enterprises.  Only 0.4% of women-owned enterprises are listed on the Hanoi and HCMC Stock Exchange.\n\nHow can we do better to address these four concerns?\n\nWe hope to be inspired by and learn from our keynote speakers and panelists in today’s event.\n\nI thank Viet Nam Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Viet Nam Women Entrepreneur Council, Hanoi Stock Exchange, IFC, DFAT and UN Women for organizing this event. I also appreciate everyone’s participation – as only through collaboration can we amplify our impact and accelerate progress for women.\n\nXin Cảm Ơn."}]}

However, the economic development cannot be at the cost of environmental degradation. In that context, I am pleased to see Viet Nam has been taking various steps to manage green growth.\n\nViet Nam has agreed to Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development Goals in 2015. It also made commitment to Paris Agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in Nationally Determined Contribution, Green Growth Strategy, and has strong determination to enhancing energy efficiency in the Law on Energy Efficiency and Conservation. The Ministry of Construction also adopted its sectoral Green Growth Action Plan in May 2017. Development and utilization of the Non-Fired Bricks is an essential step to achieve targets of these policies to achieve sustainable development in Viet Nam.\n\nI would like congratulate the Government of Viet Nam, especially the Ministry of Construction and Provinces for an impressive progress on the implementation of the National Non-Fired Brick development programme. I am confident that the 30-40% targets by 2020, and the long-term target of 70-80% will be achieved.\n\nLadies and GentlemenViet Nam has adopted key regulatory and policy framework to promote development and utilization of Non-Fired Brick production, such as the Government Decree 24A in 2016 on management of construction materials. This encourages development of new environmentally friendly materials, including Non-Fired Bricks production. The policy framework have enabled good development and utilization in some large cities such as Ho Chi Minh, Hai Duong, and Bac Ninh cities.\n\nHowever, the challenges exist in overall market and other cities and in legal framework, including lack of quality standards and low quality of the Non-Fired Bricks by some factories. This leads to lack of confidence among Non-Fired Brick users such as investors, architects, engineers and building developers.\n\nThe workshop on revision of the Decree 121 on the sanction of administrative violation in construction activities and Circular 09 on the use of non-fired materials in the construction works, is very timely and important.\n\nBuilding on success of revision of these Decree and Circular, I would like to encourage to develop and update a package of standards and guidelines for Non-Fired Brick products, including technical requirements, testing methods, and guidelines. Training, retraining and sharing experience is also very important to support all provinces to effectively implement and apply these policies and guidelines.\n\nLadies and GentlemenThe draft document to be presented to you today are prepared based on evidence-based policy review and analysis carried out during the 5 years of implementation of the National Non-Fired Bricks Programme.\n\nUNDP is very happy with the partnership between the Ministry of Construction, Ministry of Science and Technology to implement the important project “Promoting the Production and Utilization of National Non-Fired Bricks in Viet Nam” which provide technical support to this revision process. I am confident that under leadership of the Ministry of Construction and contribution of policymakers and experts today, we will be able to produce the effective Decree and Circular.\n\nI look forward to fruitful discussions today and wish you all good health, happiness and success.\n\nThank you!"}]}

Our gathering today comes at a critical juncture.\n\nJust over half a year ago, the Ha Long Ministerial Statement on the Strengthening of ASEAN Anticipatory Actions in Disaster Management was adopted, signaling a collective commitment to proactive measures in mitigating the impact of disasters.\n\nReflecting on this priority, the UN supported Viet Nam in translating these ambitious commitments into action.\n\nThe effectiveness of anticipatory action has already been tested by the UN in a number of extreme events, including Typhoon Noru in Thua Thien Hue and Quang Tri in 2022, a severe flood in Thua Thien Hue in 2023, and the ongoing drought and saline intrusion in Ca Mau. The anticipatory actions improved the food security of and reduced negative coping mechanisms employed by more than 2,000 vulnerable households. In terms of return on investment of anticipatory action; for every 1 USD spent on anticipatory action, the return on investments yields approximately 4.6 USD in the long term (Source: FAO Impact of Anticipatory Action[1]report).\n\nAs we convene today, I am encouraged by the progress we have made together. I commend the GoV for its housing support program, effectively scaling up coastal vulnerabilities, and I applaud our partnerships in bolstering early warning systems. I also highlight the Disaster Risk Reduction Partnership (DRRP). As the newly appointed co-chair of the DRRP, I am committed to advancing our shared agenda, guided by the priorities outlined in our comprehensive 5-year work plan.\n\nOur achievements result from the strong and long-standing partnership between the Vietnamese Government, especially the MARD and VDDMA with the development.\n\nHowever, much work remains to be done.\n\nWe recognize that proactive measures require sustainable support. Financing and institutionalization of anticipatory action is a key priority.\n\nEqually important is the role of data in informing anticipatory action. We need robust and granular disaster information data to capture those most at risk, and the analytical capacity to optimize use of data.\n\nCommunity-based disaster risk management remains central. Together, we must prioritize community engagement to mitigate risks on the most vulnerable, including women and children.\n\nWe also need specific policies to encourage private sector participation and investment in disaster insurance and early warning stations.  At the same time, implementing integrated solutions to build resilience for vulnerable communities are crucial steps. For example, through nature-based solutions such as mangrove forests and disaster-resilient housing.\n\nLet us reaffirm our commitment to anticipatory action and disaster risk reduction. By working together, we can build a safer, more resilient future for all.\n\nThank you!

Madame Nguyen Thi Ha, Vice Minister for Labor, Invalids and Social Affairs, Viet Nam\n\nH.E. Mr. Trieu Van Cuong, Vice Minister of Home Affairs, Viet Nam\n\nMs. Pauline Tamesis, UN Resident Coordinator, Viet Nam,\n\nMs. Elisa Fernandez, Country Representative, UN Women Viet Nam,\n\nExcellencies, Ambassadors and distinguished participants.\n\nA very good morning to all of you,\n\nAllow me to take this opportunity to share Indonesian experience on this matter.\n\nIndonesia is currently enjoying a demographic bonus. With a population of almost 280 million people, roughly 70% of which or around 198 million people are in the productive age. This is an important asset for our economy.\n\nOne sector in particular, absorbs 97% of that workforce and contributes more than 60% of Indonesia’s GDP. That sector is micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs). Currently, Indonesia has 65.4 million MSMEs and the majority of it (64.5%) is owned and managed by women.\n\nDuring the height of COVID-19 pandemic, the MSMEs were among the hardest hit, and so were the women. Women who largely depend on family income experienced extra pressures, not just from the reduced income, but also from the traditional burden sharing in the household.\n\nWhile most of the family members were working or studying from home, women-especially working mothers-were still expected to take up much of the unpaid, domestic works.\n\nNevertheless, the pandemic also brought in new opportunities as consumer spending shifted from offline to online platforms. Data from the Indonesian Central Bank (2020) showed that\n\ne-commerce sales increased by 18%.\n\nAmong new MSMEs, women-owned MSMEs benefited 8-10% more than men-owned from using digital platform. e-commerce provides alternative way for women to stay creative, productive, and empowered, especially for stay-at-home mothers and women workers in informal sector.\n\nRecognizing this potential and the role of women in the economy, the Indonesian government is committed to promote the empowerment of women through policies which consider the\n\ngender perspective.\n\nWomen are encouraged to become entrepreneurs with the support of innovation and technological development to achieve gender equality. Technological innovation makes it easier for women to start and grow businesses by providing access to funding, marketing tools and other resources, such as accounting and warehousing apps.\n\nConcrete examples of these policies include:\n\n- USD 17.8 billion in small enterprise credit for 2.4 million women entrepreneurs.\n\n- USD 1.1 billion for micro enterprise assistance program with women makes up 63.5% of its beneficiaries.\n\n- Facilitation MSMEs entry into digital ecosystem to expand access in marketing, increasing effectiveness and efficiency in business process, increasing purchasing transaction, and improving competitiveness of MSMEs.\n\n→ Government targets for MSMEs participation in digital marketplace:\n\n- Entrepreneurship training with gender perspective for vulnerable women.\n\n- Women and children-friendly villages, from district to provincial levels.\n\n- Promoting financial inclusion and literacy.\n\nDigital banking and payment system help women for greater access and manage their finances, especially where traditional banking services are limited or inaccessible.\n\nWhile digital literacy is continuing to improve, Indonesian MSMEs still faces challenges to enhance its competitiveness, to graduate into the next level.\n\nData from IMD World Competitiveness Online ranks Indonesia in 51st position out of 63 countries surveyed in 2022. Although it is still quite far away from the top, Indonesia has managed to increase its position relatively steady from the 62nd spot in 2018, even during the pandemic.\n\nThis proves that Indonesia has the capability and resilience to continue moving forward.\n\nGoing forward and to strengthen implementation of Goal 5 of the SDGs, Indonesia will put special emphasis on how to set development strategies to target vulnerabilities in the postpandemic era.\n\nTo encourage effective implementation of regulations that create competitiveness.\n\nTo encourage the financial sector to play a more active role in credit growth.\n\nTo strengthen health and education sectors as future sources of competitiveness.\n\nAll the while, maintaining gender perspective in national development policies.\n\nThese sentiments, we gladly noted, also reflected in the policy recommendations for Viet Nam.\n\nOur fellow ASEAN member has demographic characteristics that are similar to Indonesia, so we may anticipate similar challenges and opportunities in the future. Certainly we need more women entrepreneurs to maintain ASEAN as the epicentrum of growth, in line with the theme of ASEAN under Indonesia’s chairmanship this year,\n\nWe appreciate the opportunity to be a part of this timely dialogue.\n\nThank you."}]}

We are heartened to once again see such a high level of interest and participation to commemorate International Women's Day. Gender equality is critical to all three key pillars of the United Nations: peace and security, development and human rights.\n\nLadies and gentlemen,\n\nIt is my pleasure to open thisInternational Women's Day policy event. This year, the global theme for IWD is: \"Think equal, build smart, innovate for change\". The theme invites us to focus on innovative ways in which we can advance gender equality and the empowerment of women, particularly in the areas ofsocial protection systems, access to public services and sustainable infrastructure.\n\nThe reflections and recommendations drawn from today's policy event will inform Viet Nam's position at this year'sCommission on the Status of Women, which will take place at the United Nations Headquarters in New York from 11 to 22 March 2019. I will, therefore, focus my intervention on the three areas just mentioned.\n\nSocial protection systems, public services and sustainable infrastructure are critical for accelerating both the implementation of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action and the achievement of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. SDG 5 explicitly acknowledges the importance of 'public services, infrastructure and social protection policies' under Target 5.4 on unpaid care and domestic work. SDG 1 underlines the urgency of building social protection systems and measures for all. SDG 9 commits to the development of quality, reliable, sustainable and resilient infrastructure with a focus on affordable and equitable access for all. And, SDG 10 calls for fiscal, wage and social protection policies to progressively achieve greater equality.\n\nThe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Developmentaffirms the crucial importance of gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls as both a goal in its own right and a key ingredient of success across the Agenda as a whole. But we still have a long way to go to achieve gender equality. According to the 2017 World Economic Forum, it will take 170 years to close just the economic gender gap if we do not take strong and urgent action now.\n\nThe connections among the three areasare particularly important because they are critical elements for achieving gender equality, especially if we consider the kinds ofconstraints that women face as a result of their unpaid care responsibilities.\n\nViet Nam has made a great deal of progress in strengthening legal frameworks and delivering on its social protection commitments. However, women still face challenges in accessing social protection. For example, while women face some of the same risks as men that make them vulnerable to poverty—such as illness, unemployment and frailty due to old age, they also face a number of gender-specific risks - such as childbearing, unpaid family responsibilities, and lack of property co-ownership legal title deeds, which can hamper their efforts to have an income of their own.\n\nWhile social protection coverage has increased during the last decade, theworld is still a long way from achieving comprehensive coverage for all; and where sex-disaggregated data is available, it often shows that women are overrepresented among those who remain excluded from social protection. This is also true of Viet Nam, where the majority of women in the labour force work in the informal sector, which excludes them from accessing social protection.\n\nPublic services and investments in sustainable infrastructure are essential for reducing and redistributing unpaid care work, and for supporting livelihoods including by facilitating women's access to income through labour markets. A study done by Action Aid in Viet Nam in 2015 involving nearly 8,000 participants showed that a woman in Ha Giang province can save 54 working days per year (nearly two months) if clean water is provided to her household. In Ho Chi Minh City, a study conducted by UN Women in 2016 discovered that the public transportation service is not well adapted to the safety needs of women and girls. This results in restricted mobility, which then impacts women's access to jobs and other socioeconomic activities.\n\nYesterday, I attended the ceremony to launch the 2019 priority of the Viet Nam Women's Union:Safety for Women and Girlstogether with Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc. The safety of women and girls cannot be separated from issues we are discussing here today. It requires attention to gender responsive investment in infrastructure, which is critical for making cities and human settlements inclusive, safe and sustainable.Public spaces and transportation systems, however, are rarely planned with women's mobility and safety in mind.\n\nThe availability ofchildcare services as well as safe sanitation facilitiesare also critical for women in order for them to be able to take advantage of key social protection initiatives, such as public works programmes, on an equal basis with men.\n\nExtending electricity, transport, water and sanitation to rural and marginalized urban areas, in turn, is indispensable tofree time up that many women and girls currently spendon collecting and purifying water or processing fuel and firewood, which they could instead use to pursue educational and employment opportunities.\n\nWhen we look at key areas of social protection, public services and infrastructure, we need more women decision-makers at the highest policy levels in all these three areas. And we also need to ensurestronger policy coordination and synergies across sectorsfor better results for women and girls. For example:\n\nLadies and gentlemen,\n\nSocial protection, public services and sustainable infrastructure are integral elements of the 2030 Agenda and critical to the achievement of gender equality across all the 17 sustainable development goals. In order to achieve these goals, the UN would like to suggest five key priorities for Viet Nam:\n\nWe must not accept another year in which progress towards gender equality remains at a standstill, or worse still, slides back even if only in some areas. And we certainly cannot wait another 170 years for closing only the economic gender gap! Former UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon said \"Countries with more gender equality have better economic growth. Companies with more women leaders perform better. Peace agreements that include women are more durable. Parliaments with more women enact more legislation on key social issues such as health, education, anti-discrimination and child support. The evidence is clear:equality for women means progress for all.\"\n\nThe United Nations stands ready to support the people of Viet Nam in this important journey.\n\nI wish you all a very fruitful discussion.\n\nXin Cam on!"}]}

We learnt that more and more new cases of COVID-19 have been reported from Bac Giang, Bac Ninh, and HCMC, and most of the affected populations are female workers. We have trust in the Government of Vietnam and the provincial authorities for successfully controlling the 4th outbreak very soon, as done in the past.\n\nHowever, the COVID-19 pandemic has heavily affected many countries in the world, including Viet Nam. The pandemic has also exacerbated existing inequalities and disproportionately affected vulnerable populations. The social and family pressures as a result of COVID 19 containment measures, loss of jobs, uncertainties and reduced household income can make women more vulnerable to domestic violence. During the two months of the social-distancing period from 1 April to 31 May 2020, the number of calls for help in UNFPA-supported help-lines and hot-lines increased twice compared to the same period in the previous year. This clearly demonstrates the vulnerability of women and girls to domestic violence as a negative consequence of COVID-19.\n\nThe UNFPA-supported National Study on Violence Against Women, which was conducted in the pre COVID-19 year of 2019, already showed that 62.9% of ever-married women have experienced at least one form of physical, sexual and/or emotional violence in their lifetime by their husbands and intimate partners, and 90.4% of these women never sought any help from formal services or authorities. Violence by a husband is extremely common in Viet Nam, and it is important to emphasize that violence against women affects not only individual victims and their families, but also Vietnam’s economic development. The overall productivity loss caused by violence against women was estimated at 1.8% of GDP in 2018, according to the National Study. And therefore, it is important to look at violence against women and girls as a development issue.\n\nDistinguished guests,\n\nThe Dignity Kit is a signature product of UNFPA's comprehensive package of humanitarian assistance to safeguard sexual and reproductive health and rights of women and girls, prevent and respond to gender-based violence, and protect the dignity of women and girls who are adversely affected by a crisis. Preserving dignity is essential to maintaining women’s self-esteem and confidence, which is crucial in stressful and potentially overwhelming humanitarian situations.\n\nToday, about 5,100 Dignity Kits are handed over to the Viet Nam Farmer Union, who will then take charge of the distribution to women and girls in Bac Giang (2,397 kits), Bac Ninh (1,438 kits), and HCM City (1,259 kits). The Dignity Kit comprises the basic items that women and girls need to protect themselves and maintain hygiene, respect, and dignity in the face of crisis.\n\nIn addition to the essential items to meet the special need of women in humanitarian settings, dignity kits include information on gender-based violence, such as what it is, and how to deal with it, and it also includes instructions to link women to available support services. Korean Cooperation (KOICA) has been partnering with UNFPA in the past years to set up a model of such a service provision in Quang Ninh province, as well as the hotline services for the entire country.\n\nWe must ensure that all women and children in Viet Nam, including those most vulnerable such as in COVID-19 context, live a life free of violence, and support for them should be prioritized as part of the COVID-19 response. Gender-based violence is a development issue, and prevention and effective response to gender-based violence is about making sure that everyone is part of the country’s sustainable development process, leaving no one behind.\n\nOnce again, I would like to extend our sincere appreciation to KOICA, the Government of Australia and the Government of Japan for providing funding to help women and girls at risk of violence, and the Viet Nam Farmer’s Union for its strong commitment for the delivery of our dignity kits down to communities.\n\nThank you."}]}

Xin Chao!\n\nIt is with great pleasure that I welcome you all on behalf of the United Nations to the Final Pitching Round for the National Essay Competition to Commemorate the 75th Anniversary of the United Nations. This is another very important UN 75th Anniversary commemoration event. I understand there were 156 applicants from all across the country including one online participant from Australia, and there are 6 finalists today. Congratulations to the finalists. This event follows closely on the heels of the UN 75th Anniversary Photo Contest in 2020 for which we got close to 1000 entries of which four were given prizes at a ceremony at the Viet Nam Women’s Museum a few months ago and close to 50 of the most meaningful and striking photographs were on display there for 2 weeks after the prize winning ceremony. These photo exhibits then moved to the Daewoo Hotel where we commemorated the 75th Anniversary of the United Nations in late October. The photo contest was a major UN-wide event led by our Vice-Chair of the One UN Communications Group, Elisa Fernandez-Saenz, the UN Women Representative in Viet Nam.\n\nI wish to offer our sincere gratitude to our Panel of Expert Judges today, in particular our good friends and partners of the United Nations, Madame Nguyen Phuong Nga, and Mr Do Hung Viet, both of whom I had also invited to be on the 6 person judging panel for the 75th Anniversary Photo Contest which I chaired. While DG Viet was able to join that panel as well—and so he can now be regarded as a veteran of such judging panels—Mdme. Nga had another prior commitment that day, so I am very pleased that she can join us today. Both senior Vietnamese diplomats have served Viet Nam with great distinction at the United Nations in New York, including, in the case of Mdme. Nga, as Permanent Representative of Viet Nam to the United Nations in New York during the negotiations and adoption of the UN Sustainable Development Goals in 2015. Both still continue to demonstrate their tremendous commitment to the work of the United Nations even after their return to Viet Nam from New York for which I am grateful. Special thanks to Mdme. Nga for her contribution to this event. I am told by UNDP that she helped launch and promote the competition at an Inspirational Talks event with over 100 students at the University of Languages and International Studies on 13 November. We at the UN, and our young essay finalists, are honored to have both of you here with us this morning.\n\nI would also like to take this opportunity to congratulate Viet Nam on the recent adoption by the UN General Assembly of the ‘International Day for Epidemic Preparedness’ on December 27, Louis Pasteur’s birthday. The successful effort on this was led by Viet Nam with the support of a number of other UN Member States and reflects the growing standing of Viet Nam in the international community on this critical set of issues, in particular following its swift and effective management of the health aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Its leadership on the global stage is, however, not just restricted to this area. Its leadership in the UN Security Council on the Women, Peace and Security Agenda since 2009 when it sponsored UNSCR 1889 and by hosting the recent December 7-9 2020 hybrid conference on Women, Peace and Security in Hanoi—with UN support led by me and Vietnamese Government preparations led by DG Viet—leading to the Hanoi Commitment to Action is yet another good example as is Viet Nam’s increasing contribution to global peacekeeping, including by having already met the global target for the proportion of women peacekeepers in its UN contingents.\n\nIn this context, a key message that I would like to share with all of you is that while the partnership between the United Nations and the Government of Viet Nam has been a special and close one for over four decades now since it joined the UN in September 1977, this relationship has evolved over time as it should, and now focuses not only on what the UN can do to support the Government of Viet Nam and its people inside the country but also regionally and globally—the latter has been and remains an important priority for me as UN Resident Coordinator. Viet Nam has made important contributions to multilateralism globally as I have just illustrated, including by helping to protect peace and advance friendly relations among nations. It also chaired ASEAN in 2020 with numerous achievements including agreements of the next ASEAN-UN Plan of Action 2021-2025 agreed at the ASEAN Summit in Hanoi almost exactly a month ago. It is also increasingly participating in South-South cooperation efforts, sharing its successful poverty reduction and other experiences with other nations to help improve the lives of their citizens. Domestically, by dramatically increasing per capita GDP manifold since 1990, significantly reducing extreme poverty, hunger, disease and illiteracy since Doi Moi in 1986, and improving respect for citizen’s rights and freedoms, the Government of Viet Nam has increased the quality of life for all Vietnamese over the last three decades.\n\nOver 20 resident and non-resident agencies of the UN, including UNDP, currently work closely with government partners and non-state actors in Viet Nam under my leadership to advance the SDGs. I am told that essay finalists here this morning have captured both the domestic and international aspects of the UN’s partnership with Viet Nam and I look forward to reading more about this later in your essays.\n\nAs Resident Coordinator of the UN in Viet Nam, I have been in the privileged position to grow and advance the important partnership between the UN and Viet Nam over the past almost 4 years not just domestically but also in its regional and global dimensions as I have already indicated. We will now try and agree on a new partnership framework for the next 5 years starting 2022, in the context of both UN Development System Reform and the COVID-19 pandemic whose socio-economic impact remains severe globally, including for Viet Nam at the country level. In this context, on 2 nd December 2020, I co-chaired an informal Roundtable Discussion with Mr. Le Hoai Trung, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs reviewing both the SDG results achieved through our One Strategic Plan 2017-2021 thus far, also beginning to identify agreed areas of priority in the Decade of Action in a post pandemic context, seeking to Leave No One Behind as we move forward to achieving Agenda 2030. The UN and Government of Viet Nam’s next One Strategic plan 2022-2026, or the UN SDG Cooperation Framework as it is now known globally by the UN, will be critical in Viet Nam’s efforts to achieve the ambitious Sustainable Development Goals which comprise the 2030 Agenda. This afternoon, I will have my first meeting with the newly appointed Vice Minister of the Ministry of Planning and Investment to officially start the process of agreeing a Roadmap for the preparation and agreement of this next UN Cooperation Framework which we hope to agree with the Government of Viet Nam by mid-2021.\n\nLadies and Gentlemen,\n\nWhat I can say confidently, and with great pleasure, is that the strong partnership between the UN and Viet Nam is as strong as ever and should grow even stronger in the years ahead. As I said in my speech earlier this year to mark the 75th anniversary of the United Nations which I commemorated on the UN’s behalf together with His Excellency Deputy Prime Minister/Foreign Minister, Pham Binh Minh, who represented the Government of Viet Nam at it, we are living in extremely challenging times. Let us remind ourselves that the decisions we make today will significantly impact the future we want. And in this regard, the partnership between the UN and Viet Nam remains as important as ever, to meet the challenges that face not just Viet Nam but all of us globally and in the region. We all have both a responsibility and obligation to make the right decisions for succeeding generations. To quote from the Secretary-General’s 2020 UN Day statement commemorating our 75th Anniversary: “The United Nations not only stands with you, but it belongs to you and is you. Together, let us uphold the enduring values of the United Nations Charter.”\n\nAllow me to conclude by thanking UNDP for taking the lead on this essay competition initiative which should make an important contribution to the UN’s many events this year commemorating our 75th Anniversary. I also wish to once again thank our Judges and especially our Young Essay Finalists whose timely reflections on both what this partnership has achieved so far and what it should focus on as Viet Nam moves forward in the region and the world over the coming decades will be very important for us to reflect on at the UN as we begin the process of drafting our new Cooperation Framework for the 2022-2026 period in January 2021 in this Decade of Accelerated Action to achieve the SDGs in an extremely challenging and dramatically changed post-COVID-19 world.\n\nI thank you for listening. Xin Cam on!"}]}

We will hear shortly today about the implications for SMEs, and for poor and vulnerable consumers, and how well transitional measures have succeeded.The work has been important for Viet Nam to examined how Viet Nam might pursue a set of reforms which were simultaneously environmentally sustainable and socially equitable.  Viet Nam’s commitment is particularly important in the context of global development frameworks that Viet Nam is also committed to.\n\nFirst framework is the Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development, SDGs, adopted by world leaders in Sep 2015. The issue we discuss today is at the core of Viet Nam’s efforts in achieving SDGs: particularly SDG 1, poverty eradication, and SDG 7, which calls us to secure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all by 2030.\n\nSeondly, at the 2015 Paris Climate Conference (COP21), 195 nations negotiated an historic climate agreement—one that declared that not only do we need to hold the increase in the global average temperature to “well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels” but we also need to pursue efforts to limit the increase to 1.5°C.\n\nUNDP is committed to supporting the government in its ambitous endeavour in achieving those goals.\n\nLooking back in the history of the study series, the Phase 1 established the core economic and environmental case for fossil fuel fiscal reforms. Its research findings contributed to ensuring the Government’s commitment to phasing out fossil fuel subsidies, as subsequently given in the Green Growth Strategy and the Green Growth Action Plan.  Phase 2 looked at the political economy of reform, and phase 3 provided recommendations on fiscal policies to enable renewable power generation and offer a road map for reform, which could easily be taken up by Government and EVN.\n\nWhile this final fourth phase includes a review of both the impacts on SMEs and the vulnerable, today’s session focuses on the latter.  This is based on an explicit recognition, based on the findings from phases 1 and 2, that the near term effects for those on low incomes could be considerable.  Encouragingly, Government took these earlier findings on board – and maintained a simplified block tariff and rolled-out a cash transfer for the poor.\n\nYou will hear today the authors’ radical new thinking soon – offering a couple of options.  I emphasize these measures do not re-impose a social responsibility on EVN, but rather they re-shape the tariff to maximize welfare and redistribute between users.  They offer the basis of a socioeconomically and environmentally sustainable charging system – both protecting the poor and incentivizing energy efficiency.\n\nI conclude by underling that this remains an important policy area. It is right time for the current mitigation measures to be assessed and reappraised.  It brings together several policy themes – including economic growth, poverty reduction and social protection and environmental sustainability.\n\nI acknowledge the strong contribution of the two VASS research teams, and CIEM colleagues. I thank the UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the UK Embassy in Ha Noi for their financial support and continued interest in these important topic areas. I do hope it is something we can take forward.\n\nI wish all participants well with the discussions. I reiterate UNDP’s commitment to supporting Government to deliver environmentally sound and socially equitable reforms in the power sector.  Xin cam on!"}]}

The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is a shared promise by every country to work together to secure the rights and well-being of everyone on a healthy, thriving planet.\n\nThis promise is fading. A fundamental shift is needed – in commitment, financing and action – to put the world on a better path. The time is now!\n\nHow are we doing in Viet Nam?\n\nThe second Voluntary National Review (VNR) of Viet Nam submitted in 2023 reported considerable progress in various goals and targets, particularly those related to Goals 1, 6, 9, 10, 16 and 17. The report also called for greater investments and expedited implementation for Viet Nam to realize all SDGs by 2030.\n\nTo accelerate efforts, the Government of Viet Nam prioritized two key actions. One, enhancing institutional arrangements for the SDG implementation. And two, refining the Viet Nam SDG Indicators (VSDG Indicators), including data for monitoring implementation.\n\nThis year, Viet Nam reaffirmed its unwavering commitment to accelerating SDG implementation. At the 79th session of the UN General Assembly and at the Summit of the Future in September, Party General Secretary, H.E. Mr. To Lam welcomed the adoption of thePact for the Future.\n\nThe Pact for the Future is about turbocharging the SDGs and the Paris Agreement, accelerating a just transition away from fossil fuels, and securing a peaceful and livable future for everyone on our planet.\n\nWhat remains to be done?\n\nThe Mid-Term Review of the National Action Plan on the Implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (NAP 2030) is an important opportunity to learn from the past and to set a more focused direction. It is also a chance to mobilize stakeholder engagement and resources – financial, technical, and knowledge. And equally importantly, to enhance institutional coordination for accelerated implementation.\n\nViet Nam is well-positioned to take transformative actions and create breakthroughs to turbocharge SDG implementation by:\n\nAll six priorities, outlined in the 2nd VNR, are envisioned to generate large multiplier effects across SDGs to promote economic prosperity, while protecting human and environmental wellbeing. This is also the reason why the UN in Viet Nam has stepped up support in all six priority areas.\n\nThis Mid-Term Review is also an important contribution to the preparations for the new Socio-Economic Development Plan (SEDP).\n\nIt is therefore timely and highly relevant in our collective efforts to support Viet Nam’s journey to achieve the SDGs by 2030, become a high-income country by 2045 and realize net-zero emissions targets by 2050.\n\nThank you!

Good morning.\n\nI am pleased to join you at this International Symposium on The Role of Women and the Prevention of the COVID-19 Pandemic in Peacekeeping Operations and to make a few remarks on behalf of the United Nations.\n\nAt the outset, I wish to commend General Chien, General Vinh and the Government of Viet Nam for their commitment to expanding the role of women in peacekeeping.\n\nExpanding the role of women in peacekeeping is also a key dimension of the Women, Peace and Security (WPS) agenda. UN Security Council resolution 2538 (2020), adopted on 28 August 2020, stressed anew this important goal, and the need for continued efforts to achieve it. The Action for Peacekeeping Declaration prioritizes WPS as an intrinsic and indisputable political commitment for effective peacekeeping and for sustaining peace, including through increasing the number of civilian and uniformed women in peacekeeping at all levels and in key positions.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted that gender equality is a prerequisite for resilient and equitable societies. Based on these values, the United Nations workforce will strengthen our protection efforts, and improve our own gender effectiveness, thereby further enhancing our credibility. Also, our peacekeepers should reflect the diversity of the communities we serve. Women bring different life experiences and perspectives, and are in an ideal position to encourage and empower other women to follow in their path and serve as role models for our personnel and the communities we support and protect.\n\nDistinguished Delegates,\n\nUnder the strong leadership of the Secretary-General, the United Nations continues to make headway in ensuring gender parity amongst personnel at Headquarters and in UN peace operations (i.e. in both peacekeeping operations, PKOs, and special political missions, SPMs).\n\nFor the first time in its history, the UN has reached gender parity in its top management levels as well as amongst UN Resident Coordinators. In Headquarters departments, parity has also been reached (in the aggregate).\n\nSeveral initiatives have been put in place since the introduction of the System-Wide Strategy on Gender Parity to increase the representation of female senior leaders in the field and/or support them throughout their assignments. This includes the Global Call outreach campaign, of which a second iteration was held in 2019, and the Leadership Partnering initiative (LPI), a mentoring programme offered to all newly appointed civilian and military Heads and Deputy Heads of Mission.\n\nAs a result, in the field, as of October 2020, significant progress has been made in closing the gender gap at senior mission leadership level in peace operations (both SPMs and PKOs). As of October 2020, women constitute 45% of Heads and Deputy Heads of Mission, the highest percentage ever achieved. Furthermore, there are currently three female Force or Deputy Force Commanders and over 40% of the senior police leadership positions are filled by women. Also, women make up around 24% of all civilian staff in peacekeeping operations.\n\nFor uniformed personnel, with the support of troop-and-police contributors (TCCs and PCCs), the number of women deployed in all uniformed positions has risen significantly since the launch of the Uniformed Gender Parity Strategy. Most 2020 targets established in the Uniformed Gender Parity Strategy (UGPS) for military, police and justice and corrections personnel at Headquarters and in the field have been met or surpassed. However, we are yet to achieve our targets for the percentage of women in formed contingents, and we collectively need to redouble our efforts in this area.\n\nAt the UN, while we are proud of the progress made thus far, we are not complacent. While much has been achieved, the support of Member States remains critical to maintaining hard-won gains. We must strengthen our collective efforts to ensure that women can participate effectively and meaningfully in peacekeeping.\n\nI am pleased to advise you that there is currently a campaign called ‘Peace is my Mission’, aimed both at promoting the role of women working in PKOs and SPMs and at attracting more women (https://peacekeeping.un.org/en/peace-is-my-mission). My Resident Coordinator’s Office can share details of this with the Ministry of National Defence later. The website includes an animation video on how to apply for UN jobs in the field, an overview video summarizing the campaign, and individual profiles of women peacekeepers.\n\nLadies and Gentlemen,\n\nAllow me to turn to the ASEAN context, including the ASEAN-UN partnership.\n\nAt the 11th ASEAN-UN Summit on 15 November 2020 which I attended, the UN Secretary-General expressed ‘gratitude for ASEAN’s endorsement of the Action-for-Peacekeeping Agenda as well as for ASEAN’s contribution of around 5,000 peacekeepers to 10 UN peace operations, including an increasing numbers of women peacekeepers.\n\nWe thank Viet Nam, as the Chair of ASEAN for 2020, for its role in guiding the finalization of the second Plan of Action (POA) between ASEAN and the UN (2021-2025), adopted at the Summit. The new POA provides for new opportunities to strengthen cooperation in peace operations between ASEAN and the UN in the context of the Action for Peacekeeping Initiative.\n\nAmong the areas of focus, the POA provides the opportunity to ‘enhance contributions of peacekeepers as well as the participation of women peacekeepers’ and to explore further cooperation ‘to provide continued training assistance in peacekeeping to ASEAN, including training in humanitarian affairs and civil-military coordination, gender issues, health, safety and security arrangements and child protection, prevention of sexual exploitation and abuse’.\n\nIn addition, the POA provides the opportunity to ‘support ASEAN’s efforts in strengthening the ASEAN Peacekeeping Centres Network, including through the sharing of lessons learned, such as from UN cooperation with regional organisations, best practices, and capacity building’.\n\nThe United Nations looks forward to further strengthening cooperation with ASEAN in the critical area of peacekeeping support to enhance training and deployments from ASEAN, including those of women peacekeepers, as a vital contribution to the maintenance of both global and regional peace and security.\n\nDistinguished Delegates,\n\nIn accordance with the previous ASEAN-UN Plan of Action for 2015-2020, and under the Triangular Partnership Project (TPP) of the UN, the UN’s Department of Operational Support (DOS) has been conducting peacekeeping engineering training for troop contributing countries in ASEAN and its surrounding regions since late 2018. Over the last year, DOS conducted a training in the operation of heavy engineering equipment in Viet Nam in late 2019 for 20 Vietnamese trainees, and also a Training of Trainers (ToT) course for Heavy Equipment Operators in Viet Nam from 10 February to 13 April 2020 for 20 trainees from Bhutan, Cambodia, Indonesia, Nepal, and Viet Nam.\n\nWhile further TPP engineering courses planned for 2020 in Indonesia had to be postponed due to COVID-19 related global travel restrictions, DOS is currently developing remote engineering courses to be launched in 2021. TPP on-site training will resume when the global COVID-19 situation improves, and travel and other restrictions are lifted. The TPP engineering training location rotates every two years in the ASEAN region. Following the successful conduct of training in Viet Nam, courses will be next conducted in Indonesia, Thailand and Cambodia. The TPP training will continue under the new ASEAN-UN POA.\n\nLast but not least, I am pleased to inform you that the Government of Viet Nam will organize a global event on WPS between 7-9 December with support from the UN. It will be one of the highlights of Viet Nam in 2020 in its role as a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council. It is hoped that the outcomes from the seminar today can, at least informally, feed into our December plenary session on the ‘Future of Women in Peacekeeping’, for which we have been in getting UN Under-Secretary-General Jean-Pierre Lacroix of the Department of Peace Operations to be a keynote speaker, together with high level participants from India and Canada.\n\nPlease accept the UN’s and my personal best wishes to you all for a successful symposium.\n\nThank you! Xin cảm ơn!"}]}

Viet Nam is a dynamic, emerging economy with 73% of women participating in the economy. This is the 3rd highest rate in the 10 ASEAN economies where the average is around 65.5% and some upper middle income countries have much lower rates. Thanks to growing opportunities in the export sector, female employment in manufacturing in Vietnam is growing at a faster pace than male employment, and the proportion of women wage workers with social insurance is substantially higher than men who work more in the domestic private sector. It is clear that women are contributing significantly to Viet Nam's GDP growth rate and that rate would be much lower if it was not for the significant economic contribution of women.\n\nHowever, we also have evidence that the economic growth of the country is not necessarily translating into greater gender equality for all.\n\nAs there will be a full presentation today on the current state of women in the economy, I will refrain from going into great detail but here are some facts to give you a sense of the challenges which remain.\n\n- Only 29% of working women are engaged in wage employment compared to almost 40% of working men. Wage employment is often associated with better working conditions and socio-economic status.\n\n- On the other hand, more women than men are in vulnerable employment due to a larger share of women working as family workers (such as on family farms or in family business) with no independent access to income.\n\nDespite gender parity in education which has significantly improved even at higher levels, the gender gap between average male and female annual earnings has widened from 13% in 2004 to 20% in 2012. The causes include decline in the share of employed women with technical qualifications, strongly gender-stratified fields of study, and persistent employer stereotypes that lead to women clustered in low-paying sectors and occupations.\n\nWomen in Viet Nam also still face discrimination in law, such as the unequal retirement age which the UN Committee on Elimination of Discrimination against Women has recommended that the Government review and address.\n\nWe also know that rigid gender and cultural norms are restricting women's opportunities. Women in Viet Nam, as in many other places around the world, bear the disproportionate burden of domestic work and care work and they are expected to balance this responsibility with productive work.\n\nThis unpaid care work of women is not economically valued and adequately supported through social policies such as maternity protection that is available also for workers in the informal economy. As Viet Nam faces a rapidly aging population that will require care, we anticipate that the burden on women will only be increasing if affordable social services are not offered.\n\nWe cannot talk about the changing world of work without touching on technology. Viet Nam is yet to witness the impact of technology in the workplace to the same degree as some of its more economically advanced ASEAN neighbors. This is due to the high cost of upgrading technology and the lack of skilled workers to operate the technology. However, the question is not if, but when, the advances will affect Viet Nam. ILO estimates indicate that 86 per cent of all wage workers in Viet Nam's textiles, clothing and footwear manufacturing could face a high risk of automation due to advances in technological engineering. This could have a profound impact on women workers in particular, who across all industries in Viet Nam are 2.4 times more likely than men to be employed in an occupation at high risk of automation.\n\nLadies and gentlemen,\n\nThe SDGs seek to leave no one behind, and that means no women or girls should be left behind. Transforming the world of work for women requires the elimination of structural barriers and discriminatory laws and social norms to create equal economic opportunities and outcomes. Let me offer a few recommendations.\n\nFirst, we must work to eliminate occupational segregation by addressing discriminatory social norms and promoting women's equal participation in the labour market, education and training. We must support women, particularly young women's, access to skills and training in new and emerging fields, especially science, technology, engineering and mathematical education and digital fluency, by expanding the scope of education and training opportunities. This will enable women to diversity their occupational choice and enter jobs in emerging fields and growing economic sectors.\n\nSecondly, we need to expand and reprioritize fiscal expenditure for social protection and care infrastructure, such as, early childhood education and health care, elderly care, and maternity protection to reduce the burden of care work on women. This includes establishing universal social protection floors as part of the national social protection system in order to ensure access to social protection for all, including workers outside of the formal economy.\n\nThird, as agriculture still remains the dominant sector of employment in Viet Nam, more so for women than for men, we need to invest in improving the productivity and earning capacity of women who rely on agriculture as their main source of livelihood and ensure that small-scale women farmers are not left behind in efforts to promote contract farming linked to the global economic value chain.\n\nLastly, the government of Viet Nam must continue to remove discrimination in laws such as the unequal retirement age for women and men. It also has to establish and strengthen the compliance mechanism to hold employers accountable for implementing the many good provisions that exist in the laws to promote women's right to decent and productive work.\n\nI hope today's dialogue will mark an important milestone in our journey – one when we celebrate the significant progress made but also recognize how much more we need to do, and where we make the necessary commitments and investment to bring about lasting change and transformation for gender equality in Viet Nam.\n\nThe United Nations stands ready to support the people of Viet Nam in this journey.\n\nXin Cam On!"}]}

It is also a day to recognize global youth as agents of change and leaders of the future, and to advocate for a stronger inclusion of young people in sustainable development progress and in society more broadly, which is key to progressing the 2030 Agenda and achieving the Sustainable Development Goals.\n\nThis years' International Youth Day, jointly organized by the UN, the Ministry of Home Affairs and the Viet Nam Youth Union, is commemorating the theme \"Youth Empowerment for the country's development\", which is dedicated to celebrating young people's contributions to sustainable development and transformation as well as inclusion, social justice, and sustainable peace.\n\nThe current generation of youth is the largest in history, and young people often comprise the majority in countries confronting major development challenges. Therefore, considering the needs and aspirations of youth in matters of socio-economic development, climate change, peace and security, amongst others, is a demographic imperative. There are about 1.79 billion young people between the ages of 10 and 24 globally, who account for a quarter of the world's population. While sometimes overlooked, youth play a positive, inspirational and active role in promoting socio-economic growth, peace, and sustainable development.\n\nAgenda 2030 for Sustainable Development is committed to fostering peaceful and inclusive societies. It affirmed that \"Sustainable development cannot be realized without peace and security\". Sustainable Development Goal 16 – Promoting peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development – aims to ensure responsive, inclusive, participatory and representative decision-making at all levels. The United Nations World Programme of Action for Youth provides a policy framework and practical guidelines to improve the situation of young people, and encourages governments to \"promote the active involvement of youth in maintaining peace and security\".\n\nLadies and Gentlemen,\n\nViet Nam is experiencing a period of demographic dividend, recording the highest proportion of young people in the country's history. According to the Viet Nam Population Change and Family Planning Survey in 2015, more than 28 million, a third of the population, are youth and adolescents below the age of 29 years. This demographic window of opportunity presents Viet Nam with a timely and unique opportunity to plan for a transformation and make its next generation of leaders and advocates the drivers of social, environmental and economic progress.\n\nI would like to congratulate the Government of Viet Nam for their considerable efforts in improving the participation of adolescents and youth in the development of youth-related policies and frameworks, especially in the context of reaching middle-income status and achieving significant and rapid economic milestones. Unfortunately, rapid economic development often comes with increased socio-economic inequalities that influence youth participation – the better educated the youth are in Viet Nam, the more interest they will show in political or societal issues, and will more likely become members of an organization or contribute voluntarily.\n\nHowever, the lack of recognition of the importance of youth empowerment by both policy makers and by youth themselves has created a barrier to the meaningful participation of young people. Gaps between policies and the practical needs of young people remain and these gaps prevent young people from reaching their full potential in contributing to the country's development. Youth participation in Viet Nam is understood as youth volunteerism – and thus, youth participation in the development of policy remains low. According to the 2015 National Youth Report, published by the Ministry of Home Affairs and UNFPA, less than 15% of youth have even once participated in any part of the policy development process, in part due to the lack of consultation by policy and decision-makers, and in part due to the limited availability of information on youth-related issues together with limited advocacy skills among young people.\n\nThe UN has a long-term commitment to its partnership with the Government, and I am pleased to announce that to deliver on the One Strategic Plan 2017-2021, which I signed with the Government last month, we have, among other groups, established a new Thematic Group on Adolescence and Youth that will strengthen the leading position of the UN on youth issues in Viet Nam and focus on participatory approaches for young people to gain broader access to Viet Nam's policy process, which is essential to effectively engage their participation in social, environmental and economic developments. Under the leadership of UNFPA, it brings together 10 UN agencies with a wide range of global experience and networks to support efforts related to youth in Viet Nam.\n\nInternational Youth Day should remind us all about the importance of empowering young people as important, expressive and active individuals. As members of society, they should influence policies and decisions that affect their lives through their contribution to Viet Nam's social, environmental and economic development. Today should remind us that we should view youth as partners in achieving sustainable development, and not just as subjects or beneficiaries of our efforts.\n\nLast but not least, let me convey a message to the youth in Viet Nam:\n\nYoung people like you are the future of the world. Yours will be the first generation in world history to experience a world largely free from hunger and poverty. You are also very lucky to be children and young adolescents that will come of age in a global era where young people like yourselves have more opportunities and means to publicly voice your opinions and be heard compared with any other generation before yours. It will be your responsibility sooner than you think to find peaceful solutions to the enormous social, economic and environmental challenges ahead, while respecting fundamental freedoms and the principle of equality for all. My best wishes for your future to each one of you today!\n\nI wish you all a happy International Youth Day!\n\nXin Cảm Ơn!Mr. Nguyen Trong Thua, Vice-Minister of the Ministry of Home Affairs;"}]}

I would also like to especially thank the Honorable Vice-Minister, Mr. Nguyen Viet Tien, for his inspiring opening speech.\n\nToday, we are launching two reports: one on national midwifery and one on barriers to accessing maternal and family planning services in ethnic minority communities. These two reports investigate various aspects of health care system and community reproductive health perspectives and behaviors, yet their findings are convergent and complement each other, therefore enabling the development of clear recommendations for policy makers, programme managers, health professionals, researchers and donors in designing and implementing effective reproductive health programmes. So these programmes fully contribute to achievement of the objectives of the International Conference on Population and Development and the Sustainable Development Goals in Viet Nam.\n\nThese two reports were developed by the Ministry of Health, with technical and financial support from UNFPA. We would like to thank Dr. Sarah Bales and Prof. Sue Kildea for their dedication and enthusiasm to complete the National Midwifery Report. We would also like to thank the research team of the University of Toronto and the Mekong Development Research Institute for implementing the study on \"Exploring barriers to accessing maternal health and family planning services in ethnic minority communities in Viet Nam\". And of course, we would particularly like to thank more than 4,600 ethnic minority women and health providers and managers at all levels who participated in these two important studies.\n\nDistinguished guests,\n\nNext month, on May 5th, the world will celebrate the heroic and life-saving work of midwives on the International Day of Midwives. Thanks to midwives, millions of women each year are able to exercise their right to sexual and reproductive health services, including voluntary family planning. These services help ensure wanted, healthy pregnancies and safe births.\n\nYet, far too many women lack access to these services. As a result, at global level, each year more than 300,000 women die during pregnancy and childbirth, some 3 million babies do not survive the first month of life, and another two and a half million babies are stillborn. Most of them could have been saved by the care of well-trained midwives within the framework of strong health systems.\n\nDistinguished guests,\n\nViet Nam has made substantial progress in strengthening safe motherhood and newborn health services. As indicated in the National Midwifery Report, , the national competencies for midwives, developed and introduced in line with the International Confederation of Midwives' recommendations, and the National Programme of Action (NPA) for strengthening Nursing and Midwifery services 2012-2020 approved over the past years showed the strong commitment and efforts of the Government in strengthening the national health workforce and achieving the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030. These documents also provided a framework for improving the status of midwives working at all levels, particularly at the grassroots level and in midwifery education.\n\nHowever, findings from the study on maternal and FP services in ethnic minority region indicate big geographical differences between the national average and mountainous areas. For instance, the proportion of births attended by skilled health personnel differed by 45 percentage points between ethnic minority participants and national estimates (49% vs. 94%).\n\nThe modern contraceptive prevalence rate among ethnic minorities was 57% overall, similar to the national average. However, there was wide variation between provinces and ethnic minority communities, with the rate being 75% in Kon Tum Province compared to 45% in Gia Lai Province; and 41-42% for Ba Na and Gia Rai groups to over 70% for Tay and Sedang ethnic groups.\n\nData also reveals a significant shortage of skilled birth attendants in hard-to-reach regions and a significant difference in the competency of workers who are working in the lowlands compared to the highlands. 94% of practicing midwives are trained at secondary level and only 0.8% has bachelor qualifications. If we follow Circular 26 that only midwives at level 4 can provide FP services, approximately 33,000 secondary and elementary midwives and obstetric-paediatric assistant doctors need to be upgraded to 3-year qualifications by 2025. There is a major concern about the feasibility of implementing the Circular 26 roadmap due to the still limited capacity of current midwifery training institutions.\n\nLadies and gentlemen,\n\nBefore giving the floor to my colleagues to present key findings of these reports, I would like to reiterate a few key messages and calls for action that are highlighted in the reports:\n\nFirst, more efforts are needed in improving quality of maternal health services focusing on six strategic areas: clinical guidelines, standards of care, effective interventions, measures of quality of care, relevant research, and capacity building. Community and service users are critical in identifying their needs and preferences and in managing their own health;\n\nSecond, Circular 26's scopes of responsibilities for Level IV midwives, and the timeline and alternative options for upgrade training needs to be revised urgently;\n\nThird, the midwife-led maternity care service model should be implemented as human resources and other conditions permit and enforcement measures must be taken to enforce compliance with national reproductive health service guidelines and reduce unnecessary C-section and episiotomy and other over-servicing;\n\nFourth, monitoring and evaluation by the National Assembly and MoH should be strengthened with the active participation of ethnic minority representatives to track accountabilities and responsibilities of local authorities on the performance of the local health care network in disadvantaged regions;\n\nLast but not the least, investing in human resources for health, especially for midwives, is one of the soundest investments a country can make. It is of utmost importance to reinforce the status of midwives. Midwives also need to be provided with sufficient technical guidance/protocols, medical instruments, supplies and drugs, backed up by mobile technology and with the support of other health staff for technical support in case of emergencies, including a timely and effective referral system. When midwives are properly trained, empowered and supported, they can contribute significantly to saving the lives of mothers and newborns, as well as improving the nation's economic and social productivity. Having midwives at the bedside of every pregnant woman is a highly cost-effective public health strategy. Over time there has been recognition of mobile communication technology as a way of assisting our midwives, including our ethnic minority midwives, working in remote and hard-to-reach areas of the country.\n\nDistinguished guests,\n\nPreventing maternal and newborn deaths and disabilities and empowering women to make informed, healthy choices and exercise their rights is key to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030. To make this happen, we need to expand midwifery programmes, maintaining the highest global standards, and promote an enabling environment for midwives to effectively serve the needs of women and their families.\n\nAs Viet Nam continues to progress socially and economically, we must recognize that we cannot achieve sustainable development without promoting the health - and especially the reproductive health and rights - of women and girls throughout their life cycle. The UNFPA in Viet Nam is fully committed to support the Government and people of Viet Nam to ensure that universal access to health, including sexual and reproductive health, will become a reality for all. By joining forces and working together, I believe no goal is too high to reach.\n\nOn this occasion, I urge all government sectors and development partners to join UNFPA in supporting midwives so more women survive and they, their families and communities thrive.\n\nThank you very much for your attention and participation. I look forward to discussing these issues with you further during this workshop."}]}

Ambassador Gareth Ward,\n\nMadame H' Yim Kdoh, Vice Chair of Dak Lak Provincial People's Committee,\n\nMadame Nguyen Hoa Hiep, Vice Chair of Dong Nai Provincial People's Committee,\n\nMr. Darren Lumbroso, D-MOSS Project Director,\n\nDistinguished guests,\n\nLadies and gentlemen,\n\nOn behalf of the United Nations in Viet Nam, I am delighted to be here today at the launch event of this UK Space Agency supported inter-agency project that aims to establish \"An integrated dengue early warning system driven by Earth Observations in Viet Nam.\"\n\nDengue fever is one the most rapidly spreading, mosquito borne viral diseases in the world. The incidence of dengue has grown dramatically around the world increasing 30-fold over the last 50 years. Before 1970, only 9 countries had experienced severe dengue epidemics. The disease is now endemic in more than 140 countries with around 390 million people infected annually. Not only are the number of cases increasing as the disease spreads to new areas, but explosive outbreaks are increasingly occurring.\n\nIn Viet Nam, dengue fever poses an enormous public health problem in terms of morbidity and mortality for communities. It also results in severe economic and social costs to individuals, families and society. Large scale outbreaks occurred in 1987 and 1998 with more than 200,000 cases reported during each outbreak, while since 2000, the number of cases of dengue fever in Viet Nam have more than doubled. More recently, Viet Nam experienced a large dengue outbreak in 2017 with over 170,000 cases reported including at least 38 deaths.\n\nAs dengue is highly sensitive to heat and water availability, climate change, global warming, El Niño as well as uncontrolled urbanization and migration have hampered dengue prevention efforts. Water resources in Viet Nam are under increasing stress due to overexploitation, salinization, contamination and climate change, exposing a large part of Viet Nam's population to various water-related risks, also simultaneously challenging decision makers to better manage an increasing water demand. Meanwhile, water availability directly impacts dengue epidemics due to the provision of mosquito breeding sites. Despite this, surprisingly and sadly, water availability or water resource management are rarely accounted for in dengue prediction models.\n\nLadies and gentlemen,\n\nGiven the significant correlation between weather factors and dengue incidence, a combination of water availability forecasting and dengue fever outbreak prediction enabled by satellite technology is a great innovation. The project we are launching today is exciting in that it leverages global and local expertise from across disciplines and continents to harness data and experience to create early-warning systems and analytic tools that can help Viet Nam's health systems roll-back dengue's impacts both today and in the future.\n\nAs UN Resident Coordinator in Viet Nam, I am very excited that this project has finally come to fruition after some daunting challenges we encountered along the way but which we finally overcame by using creative and innovative solutions. This project is also yet another clear example of the UN's increasing number of joint programmes in Viet Nam, drawing on multiple agencies' strengths, expertise, system-wide experiences and assets, in this case those of UNDP and WHO. Our project partners also include national and global experts and institutions: national expertise is being drawn from the MOH, the Pasteur Institute in Ho Chi Minh city, the National Institute for Hygiene and Epidemiology, the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment, and the Institute for Meteorology, Hydrology, and Environment.\n\nGlobal partners include the consortium lead, HR Wallingford, the well-known and respected London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, the UK Met Office and Oxford Policy Management. This consortium which brings together the UN with relevant national and international institutions represents a truly visionary and innovative approach to accelerating solutions and supporting decision making on health and climate issues by linking satellite, water, climate and health data. It should contribute significantly to achieving multiple SDGs and ensuring horizontal integration across them, notably SDG3- Good Health, SDG13- Climate Change and Wellbeing and SDG6- Clean Water and Sanitation. Moreover, this joint initiative also introduces the UK Space Agency to new partnerships in Viet Nam.\n\nThere is no doubt that as with all innovations, there will be challenges ahead, just as those we already encountered and overcame in getting to this stage. There will also, no doubt, be lessons to be learned both here and globally as this work develops. On behalf of the UN in Viet Nam, let me emphasize that we look forward to working with the Government, the UK Space Agency, HR Wallingford and the other multiple development stakeholders to ensure that this exciting initiative is a success.\n\nOnly true collaboration will guarantee that the innovations we will hear about today will help better manage dengue fever in the future. In so doing, we can significantly accelerate actions which will help contribute to the achievement of the 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals it embodies and change many lives here in Viet Nam for the better through this initiative.\n\nThank you for your participation in today's event.\n\nI wish you all good health and prosperity.\n\nXin cam on!"}]}

Xin chao!\n\nIt is my great pleasure to join you today, on behalf of the United Nations in Viet Nam, for theNational Launch of the Viet Nam Women's Union's theme of the year – Safety for women and children 2019. We commend both the Government of Viet Nam, and the Viet Nam Women's Union for recognizing the importance of the safety for women and children in Viet Nam. As we all know, this is not only an issue for women and girls, but equally for men and boys, and for society at large.\n\nThis year, the global theme for International Women's Day is: \"Think equal, build smart, innovate for change\". The theme invites us to focus on innovative ways in which we can advance gender equality and the equal power of women in shaping the national policy agenda, particularly in the areas ofsocial protection systems, access to public services, and sustainable infrastructure. This includes, for example, addressing the needs and priorities of women in the informal sector, ensuring their access to healthcare services, protection by the justice system as well as securing public spaces and transportation that are free from sexual harassment.\n\nLadies and gentlemen,\n\nWe know that equal power relations between women and men in all aspects of societal interaction is an essential precondition for equitable development.\n\nDespite significant improvement in the socio-economic situation of women, gender-based discrimination and violence against women and children, especially girls, remains the most pervasive violation of human rights in the world. It is also one of the least prosecuted crimes. Here in Viet Nam, data and evidence shows that many women and children are unsafe at home, at schools, at workplaces, as well as in public spaces.\n\nAs you are all aware, the UN in Viet Nam is here to assist the Government of Viet Nam to achieve Agenda 2030 and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Mainstreaming gender equality in everything we do will be essential if the SDGs are to be attained.In this context and within the framework of the One Strategic Plan 2017-2021 between the Government of Viet Nam and the United Nations which is our overarching development cooperation framework for the country till 2021, we have made addressing all forms of discrimination and violence against women and girls one of our top priorities in support of Viet Nam's implementation of the SDGs.\n\nReturning to the broader theme of this event, allow me to highlight 5 key areas through which the UN in Viet Nam can join forces with the Government, the Viet Nam Women's Union, other national stakeholders, and most importantly grass-roots voices across the country to ensure the safety of women and children:\n\nFirst, to address the root causes of gender inequality, discrimination and violence through the promotion of public awareness, thereby developing a culture of respect and equality among all genders in all contexts: at home, at schools, at workplaces and in public spaces. Prevention initiatives focusing on girls and boys in schools can effectively help change attitudes and behaviors that undervalue women and girls and legitimize gender-based violence and sexual harassment.\n\nSecond, in the provision of reliable and meaningful data on violence against women and children, both in the public and private spheres, to allow for the design of evidence-based legislation, policy priorities and an improved justice system, as well as to enable effective monitoring and evaluation.\n\nThird, to advocate and promote the leadership and full participation of women and women's organizations as well as the integration of gender equality perspectives in all areas of policy and decision making.\n\nFourth, to strengthen multi-sectoral services for women and children survivors of violence through improved coordination of essential services based on globally agreed standards in order to ensure their immediate safety and access to justice, in addition to the provision of healthcare services and social protection for women and children subjected to violence.\n\nFifth, to strengthen partnerships with development partners, civil society and the private sector as well as local grass-roots social networks for the promotion of gender equality.\n\nLadies and gentlemen,\n\nThe spirit of \"Leaving no one behind\" to achieve Agenda 2030 and the 17 Sustainable Development Goals requires that all women and children in Viet Nam feel safe, have high self-esteem, are empowered and that power is equitably distributed between all genders. A campaign alone cannot fulfil this aspiration, but it can trigger and promote important policy actions for lasting change in this direction. The United Nations is ready to work with the Government, the Viet Nam Women's Union and all Vietnamese citizens in this joint effort.\n\nXin Cảm Ơn!"}]}

Just this last Friday, the UN organized a policy-focused event with the government looking at the trends in women's labour and employment in Viet Nam and discussed different measures that are needed to ensure that women in Viet Nam would have access to full and productive employment and decent work in this time or global integration and rapid technological change.\n\nOne issue that came up again and again during the discussions was the need to break the gender stereotypes, belief of male superiority and social expectations of a good wife and daughter that trap women into shouldering all the responsibilities at home to take care of the children, the husband, the elderly parents while also trying to bring income into the home.\n\nThis unwritten rule that house work and family care work is the natural responsibility of women deprive them of the right to pursue personal development, better and decent job opportunities and career advancement opportunities as well as time for leisure and personal wellbeing. It in fact also deprives the Vietnamese society from fully benefitting from the diverse talents of women. So, the question is, how can we change this so that women can feel empowered to fulfil their right to work?\n\nToday we are going to be exploring this issue together with a number of men. For decades, IWD has been a celebration among women alone but if we think about it, gender equality is not just an issue for women but an issue that concerns men and their attitudes towards women.\n\nWith this conviction that we need to work more with men, male leaders and champions for gender equality as allies, UN Women launched HeForShe, as a solidarity platform for male gender advocates. In Viet Nam, we launched HeForShe for IWD 2015 and since then we have had many students, young people and celebrities embrace the movement on social media. A number of Ambassadors and Development partners have also joined our events, like the HeForShe MasterChef that we organized sometime ago.\n\nToday we will be looking at housework and carework and the gender expectations around it. Through games, we are going to be exploring whether carework really has to be women's work. Do men care?\n\nI am very grateful that we have a number of men who have kindly agreed to join from the government, the corporate sector, diplomatic community, celebrities, civil society group, youth to ethnic minority community.\n\nI hope that their words and actions today will inspire more men to step up and show that they care about gender equality\n\nAnd foremost, I hope you will enjoy these events.\n\nThank you"}]}

A massive shout-out to all the young people from high schools, universities, and colleges across Hanoi for showing up today.\n\nInternational Youth Day is a global moment to recognize and celebrate the one thing that will always shape our future: the voices of young people -your voices.\n\nThis year's theme, \"Local Youth Actions for the SDGs and Beyond,\" is a challenge. It's a call for us to take action, right here, right now, in your own community for the Sustainable Development Goals. We need to stop thinking that the SDGs as just something for politicians and world leaders to solve. You are the leaders, the innovators, and the ones who have the power to turn a global vision into a local reality.\n\nViet Nam's youth are a force to be reckoned with—making up about 21% of the population! The UN in Viet Nam is proud to work alongside all of you—activists, researchers, artists, entrepreneurs, and everyone in between. Your diversity is what makes you powerful, and your collective action is what will build a more just and sustainable future.\n\nSpeaking of action, let's talk about why you're here. We’re not starting the week with a dry lecture or a boring panel. We're launching the International Youth Day week in Viet Nam with a powerful series of films.\n\nToday we feature three short films from UNFPA on Gender-Based Violence. These are windows into different realities, designed to get us thinking, to spark a conversation, and to inspire us to be part of the solution.\n\nThis is just the beginning of our cinematic journey. Throughout the week, we'll be watching films from other UN agencies that will challenge you and inspire you:\n\nEach film is a chance to learn, to empathize, and to connect with stories from around the world. We're here to listen to your thoughts, so get ready to be inspired, to engage in some awesome discussions, and to make this a week that actually matters.\n\nAnd don't miss out! Besides the film series on Saturday, August 16, 2025, we're also hosting aLocal Youth Initiatives Festat Complex 01. Come explore the innovative projects and ideas from our local young creators.\n\nNow, let's get started with the first series of films."}]}

The restructuring reflects a long-term vision aligned with the goals of modernization, digital governance, and public sector integrity. Consolidating ministries clarifies responsibilities and reduces duplication, while subnational restructuring creates a leaner, more cost-effective system and strengthens regional connectivity for more balanced growth.\n\nViet Nam’s administrative reorganization also presents challenges, as reforms often disrupt existing personnel structures, institutional cultures, and long-standing practices, leading to delays in service delivery to beneficiaries and possible reluctance to adopt new approaches or embrace innovation.\n\nIt is essential for any reform to be people-centered, inclusive and leave no one behind. Allow me to highlight a few points for consideration:\n\nFirst, on-going reforms must improve citizen-centric governance and maintain focus on equity in service delivery.\n\nEfficiency must deliver for the people and ensure benefits reach everyone, especially those most often left behind: people with disabilities, women, children, ethnic minorities, the elderly, migrants, and the poor. Data from the Provincial Governance and Public Administration Performance Index (or PAPI) shows that these groups often report less positive experiences with local governance.\n\nWith the reforms, we see a concrete opportunity in bringing services closer to people. A stronger, more empowered commune level could improve both speed and equity in delivery. But to succeed, local governments need clear mandates, adequate resources, and the right capacities.\n\nSecond, unlock digital transformation and modernize public management\n\nDigital transformation gives Viet Nam a real opportunity—not just to modernize public services, but also to make them more responsive and inclusive. Reforms offer opportunities to strengthen civil registration and vital statistics to ensure that everyone counts.\n\nAt the same time, reforms can help Viet Nam attract and retain talent, especially by creating space for women and young leaders to thrive. This is essential for building a strong, future-ready state.\n\nHowever, rapid digitalization also comes with risks as we have seen with rise of online scams and cyber bullying – requiring stronger protections for children and vulnerable groups.\n\nThird, enable a modern, skilled, inclusive workforce\n\nThis is a moment to invest in people—skills, productivity, and decent jobs. Viet Nam has an opportunity to foster higher-value, greener, and more inclusive growth—including by boosting women’s leadership and creating enabling environments for young talent.\n\nFresh perspectives can best prepare Viet Nam for its demographic shifts and build the foundation for a modern care economy that can meet the needs of an ageing population.\n\nFourth, protect essential services during the transition\n\nWhile restructuring is ongoing, we must guard against disruption to essential services -- especially at subnational level. Local governments are now the primary interface for citizens in accessing health, education, child protection, and social welfare services. Newly empowered “super communes” need to manage services for significantly larger populations with limited capacity to fulfill their expanded mandates.\n\nThe UN strongly supports Viet Nam’s ambition of free essential healthcare by 2035, but during transition, things such as procurement of medicines and supplies must remain uninterrupted.\n\nFifth, guard against unintended risks\n\nThe consolidation of ministries brings clarity but may also risk diminished attention to critical social and environmental issues. For example, cross-sectoral mandates such as gender equality, disability inclusion and child protection must not lose attention nor funding. Similarly, social and environmental protection must remain cross-cutting policy priorities. And we must anticipate that changes may slow decision-making, including for ODA processes. These risks must be actively managed.\n\nTo do so, it helps to have clear legal frameworks, strong inter-agency coordination and sustained investments in local capacity building. Transparency and citizen participation are equally important to mitigate risks and ensure effective implementation.\n\nThe UN on its 80th anniversary can learn a lot from Viet Nam’s comprehensive reforms. It is in this spirit that I reaffirm the UN’s commitment to accompany you in this journey—in line with our shared aspirations to achieve the SDGs.\n\nViet Nam’s bold reforms pave the way for a more responsive, equitable, and resilient government—ready to meet the needs of all people, now and into the future.Thank you. Xin cảm ơn."}]}

The digital revolution has tremendous potential to accelerate progress towards sustainable and inclusive societies for all.\n\nWith digital transformation sweeping the world towards the Fourth Industrial Revolution, it is imperative that we ensure people with disabilities are not excluded from the workforce of the future. Digital transformation linked with edtech, remote working, fintech and networking can drive people with disabilities towards greater success and help us tap into their potential and unique skillsets.\n\nWe at the UN in Viet Nam have a disability inclusion strategy as a core part of our daily work – we are walking the talk.  Currently, there are seven women with disabilities working at the UN in Viet Nam, and we hope to recruit more staff with disabilities going forward. By learning from them, we realised that technology has opened new opportunities and is breaking down traditional barriers.\n\nIt is our objective that persons with disabilities, especially women, are empowered to fully and equally participate in Viet Nam’s development and digital transformation to achieve the SDGs, while  leaving no one behind.\n\nIn closing, I would like to take this opportunity to recognize and celebrate the women and girls who are championing the advancement of transformative technology and digital education. Let me affirm our strong commitment to working closely with the Vietnamese Government to stand by women, especially those with disabilities, to break the barriers, to overcome stereotypes and to build forward an accessible, inclusive, and sustainable world for all.\n\nWe can all do more to ensure social inclusion and gender equality in Viet Nam.\n\nThank you! Xin cam on!"}]}

Without MPI’s fruitful and close collaboration with UN ESCAP and the UN in Viet Nam in conducting a joint macroeconomic modelling exercise, we would not be here today.\n\nColleagues,\n\nViet Nam has made great strides in improving the living standards and lifting millions of people out of poverty. Building on these remarkable achievements, the leaders of Viet Nam has set a vision to become a high-income country by 2045 and realize net-zero emissions by 2050. This vision drives Viet Nam’s commitment to achieve the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\n\nViet Nam’s second Voluntary National Review (VNR) presented by HE Nguyen Chi Dung, MPI Minister at the High-Level Political Forum (HLPF) in July, already outlined six policy priorities and recommendations for SDG acceleration. They are: science, technology and innovation; quality human resource development; efficient resource management, climate change adaptation and mitigation, and green and circular economy; finance; and data availability, with people at the center of every decision, policy, and action.\n\nThese priorities are well aligned with the six SDG transitions agreed by member states at the SDG Summit -- envisioned to generating large multiplier effects across SDGs to promote economic prosperity, while protecting human and environmental wellbeing.\n\nYou may recall, the 6 transitions are on: Jobs and Social Protection, Energy, Education, Food Systems, Digital, as well as in Biodiversity and Nature Protection. Viet Nam’s SDG acceleration priorities also commits to means of implementation: in finance, data and public sector capabilities.\n\nSo how is the macroeconomic modelling going to help in taking forward Viet Nam’s SDG acceleration priorities?\n\nThis joint UN-GoV macroeconomic modelling is a follow up to Viet Nam’s VNR exercise. The modelling helps answer questions about how the government’s investments in national sustainable development priorities, such as investments in renewable energy, might affect economic, social and environmental outcomes, such as GDP growth, poverty rate and CO2 emissions.\n\nThe exercise hasgenerated empirical evidence on the synergies and trade-offs forinvestments in energy transition, social protection, education and digital transformation. The results of the modelling exercise help to make informed decisions on policy choices and interventions.\n\nI will leave the technical details in the hands of our capable team from MPI, UNESCAP and RCO to elaborate on. I highlight three initial takeaways to inspire further discussion:\n\nIn sum, results of the modeling show thatinvesting in people and the environment yields significantly positive economic and social benefits in the long run, while the pressures on the government’s fiscal space subside over time because the economic benefits outweigh the costs. It also highlights the importance of mobilizing various sources of finance, including private capital, to invest in key development priorities.\n\nOur hope is that this macro-modeling exercise provides relevant evidence for crafting policy pathways suitable for Viet Nam to accelerate SDG transformations and to ensure that they are just and equitable.\n\nThank you! Xin cam on!"}]}

Our campaign is dedicated to promoting equality, respect, and dignity for all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation, gender identity, or expression.\n\nOver the past three months, the UN in Viet Nam, particularly UNDP, UNAIDS and UN Women, have collaborated with Its T Time and iSEE to raise awareness. Through the media campaign,\"A4 Sheet - A happy beginning,\"we have raised awareness about the rights and the necessary legal framework.  We have shared over 30 powerful stories, reaching over 160,000 people across various age groups and genders.\n\nThese stories illustrate that the daily lives of transgender persons can change significantly with the supporting legislation that enables them to change their identity documents. The A4 sheet is not just a piece of paper. It is a new birth certificate or marriage license showing someone’s preferred gender identity. And it can have a powerful and positive effect on a transgender person’s lived reality.\n\nIn addition, the\"Human Library - Trans living books\" event connects journalists with transgender and gender-diverse storytellers, fostering honest conversations and amplifying trans voices.\n\nAs we celebrate Hanoi Pride Week, the JOURNEY TO FREE AND EQUAL 2023, it is our collective responsibility to ensure that every person in Viet Nam can live a life free from discrimination and prejudice.\n\nViet Nam has made progress in promoting human rights and inclusivity: same sex marriage was decriminalised; and slowly but surely awareness on LGBTI rights and health is growing and policies are developing progressively. Yet, discrimination and stigma against the LGBTI community persist. This is why UNFE Campaign aims to unite stakeholders in Viet Nam to engage in a dialogue with each other and learn about the very real challenges the LGBTI community is still facing.\n\nBy fostering open dialogue, we can create a more inclusive society. By fostering a supportive environment, we can empower individuals to live their lives with pride and confidence.\n\nThe UNFE Campaign in Viet Nam is a call to action – a call to uphold the principles of equality and human rights.\n\nThrough partnerships and joint initiatives, we can amplify our impact and ensure that the necessary resources, legal protections, and services are accessible to all.\n\nLet us work together to raise awareness, advocate for legal reforms, and create safe spaces for the LGBTI community. Together, we can build a society where every individual is free and equal, regardless of their sexual orientation, gender identity, or expression. Together, we can shape inclusivity, creating a world where every person can live free from discrimination and enjoy equal rights and opportunities.\n\nThis year’s UN Free and Equal campaign would not have been possible without each one of you. I want to extend my sincere gratitude to the organizers, partners, and volunteers who have contributed to making the UN Free and Equal Campaign a reality. Your tireless efforts have created a safe space for people from all backgrounds to come together, celebrate love, and promote equality.\n\nThank you!"}]}

The COVID-19 pandemic is generating suffering and damage in every region. It poses a far-reaching threat to human rights. As Secretary-General Guterres has warned, itthreatens not only development, but also \"enhanced instability, enhanced unrest, and enhanced conflict.\"\n\nWe do not know how the virus itself might evolve, or whether those affected will permanently be immune. We do not have complete data of who is being infected and developing the most severe symptoms -– or whether there are links to contributory factors, such as pollution. We do know that vital measures must be taken to upgrade health and social systems to ensure the greatest possible support to those most impacted by the epidemic. We know we cannot afford to leave anyone behind in this effort.\n\nAnd we know that lockdowns cannot continue forever. Exit strategies must be carefully devised to ensure our societies and people recover.\n\nToday, we have come together for this informal meeting of the Council, although we may be physically apart. I hope this contributes to the creation ofa more cooperative, global and human rights-based approach to the crisis.\n\nAll States are facing tremendous challenges. Many are demonstrating their commitment to protecting human rights through this epidemic. Others should be encouraged to do so, in order to make their efforts to tackle COVID more effective for everyone – both in their nations, and across the world.\n\nIt is natural – and necessary – for national efforts to be a strong priority in any crisis. But this is a global pandemic, and only global solidarity will ensure that we can combat it effectively. This crisis makes clear how much we need collective international action and demonstrates the value of our multilateral organizations. The United Nations was created to prevent, mitigate and more effectively address international crises. I urge all of us to work together to promote a strong, multilateral, cooperative and global approach.\n\nFirst I want to address some urgent issues regarding economic and social rights\n\nThe pandemic is exposing the damaging impact ofinequalities,in every society.\n\nIn developed countries, fault-lines in access to health care; in labor rights and social protections; in living-space; and in dignity are suddenly very visible.\n\nIn developing countries, where a large portion of the population may rely on daily income to survive, the impact could be far greater. The millions of people who have little access to health-care, and who, by necessity, live in cramped conditions with poor sanitation, and no safety net, no clean water, will suffer most. They are less likely to be able to protect themselves from the virus, and less likely to withstand a sharp drop in income.\n\nUnchecked, the pandemic is likely to create even wider inequalities, amid extensive suffering.\n\nThe universality of the threat from this virus provides the most compelling argument there has ever been for universal and affordable access to health care.Actions to upgrade public health care, in every country, are especially urgent. WHO is leading efforts to ensure that all countries are equipped to trace, isolate and treat people infected by COVID-19. This effort should be fully resourced. There will need to be a significant regional and global effort to avoid the collapse of any country's medical system – a matter of urgent interest to everyone.\n\nExtensive economic and social measures must also be taken, in every country, tolessen the shocks of this epidemic, and minimize the further growth of inequalities.The full impact of the pandemic on global and national economies has yet to be felt. Many States in every region – especially in Europe – have taken unprecedented measures to protect the rights of workers and minimize the numbers of those made unemployed. All States with sufficient resources should be encouraged to do the same.\n\nMany developing countries have less capacity to absorb and mitigate the economic and social impact of the epidemic. They may also be most vulnerable to world recession, through commodities pricing and a decline in foreign investment and of remittances, among other factors. The Secretary-General has called for measures including – but not limited to – debt alleviation, expanded access to funding through the IMF, and contributions to the Global Humanitarian Fund.\n\nWe may also need to explore new financial mechanisms to fund global solidarity. Last week the African Development Bank raised the world's largest social bond: a 3 billion US dollar fund to assist African governments to expand access to health and to other essential services and goods. This is precisely the kind of innovative thinking we need.\n\nI also want to emphasize the imperative of respect for civil and political rights during this crisis.\n\nDifficult decisions are facing many Governments. Emergency measures may well be needed to respond to this public health emergency. But an emergency situation is not a blank check to disregard human rights obligations.\n\nEmergency measures should be necessary and proportionate to meet that need. People should be fully informed about the emergency measures and told how long they will remain in effect. The enforcement of emergency measures needs to be applied fairly and humanely. Any penalties should be proportional to the offence committed and laid down by law.\n\nI am profoundly concerned by certain countries' adoption of emergency powers that are unlimited and not subject to review. In a few cases, the epidemic is being used to justify repressive changes to regular legislation, which will remain in force long after the emergency is over.\n\nI am also concerned by steps taken to impose restrictions on media freedom and freedom of expression. Vaguely formulated actions to combat alleged \"misinformation\" could be applied to any criticism, and in some countries we have already seen reports of journalists being penalized for reporting a lack of masks; health-workers reprimanded for saying they lack protection; and ordinary people arrested for social media postings about the pandemic.  Criticism is not a crime.\n\nI urge all Governments to greatly increase access to accurate information and statistics. Transparency is paramount and can be life-saving in a health crisis. I also urge an end to any blanket Internet and telecommunication shutdowns and denials of service.\n\nWhen members of military forces conduct law enforcement functions, they should be accountable to civilian authorities, and they remain subject to international human rights law.WHO strongly advises that health and social measures to combat COVID-19 be implemented with the full engagement of the public, because respect for human rights – including the rights to speak up, and to meaningfully participate in decisions – is an essential lever of successful public health policies. The only effective way to fight an epidemic is with the public's trust.\n\nWhat to do?\n\nI see two areas of action: the immediate response to the epidemic, and preparation of the recovery.\n\nRegarding the response, I want to share with you some action points that are immediately relevant and will assist in devising effective and humane policies.\n\n1. All national efforts should seek to mitigate the impact of the epidemic on women, and on vulnerable groups.\n\nWomenare more likely than men to work in low-wage and informal sectors, without paid sick leave, health insurance or social protection. Elderly women are also more likely than men to be subsisting without any form of pension. Confinement measures are creating additional burdens for many women, including the burden of caring for the sick, the elderly and children no longer attending school. Women and girls are also facing increased risks of domestic violence, as recent statistics from France and Spain have demonstrated. For purposes of remote schooling, girls globally have less access to Internet and cell-phones than boys. These impacts may not be immediately visible, but they could set back the cause of women's equality.\n\nSeveral high-risk and vulnerable groups require greater attention, and mitigation measures, at this time. They includepeople in places of detention and other institutions– including psychiatric institutions and orphanages;people with disabilities; indigenous peoples and minorities; migrants, refugees and internally displaced people; people in conflict zones; and, in particular, older people, especially those living alone or in institutions.\n\nSpecific guidance on most of these areas has been issued or is in preparation.\n\nNotably, I refer you to our guidance regardingpeople in detention facilities,whose number should be carefully reduced, to avoid an explosive spread of the virus in closed and overcrowded settings. Iran recently took action to release, at least temporarily, 40% of its prison population. Indonesia will also release prisoners accused of minor crimes. And so on, with other countries. I urge all states to release all those detained without a lawful basis, including those held in violation of human rights obligations. I am also concerned that some countries envision prison sentences for violating orders on physical distancing: this is likely to exacerbate the epidemic.\n\nPeople with disabilitiesmust often rely on others for help with daily tasks, and confinement regulations should ensure that support is available.\n\nManymigrantsare at very high risk of contagion, because of their living conditions and limited access to healthcare. I commend Portugal for taking action last week to temporarily grant all migrants in the country full citizenship rights, to enable them to access all healthcare systems.\n\n2. Extensive measures must be taken in every country to absorb the economic and social shocks of this epidemic, and to minimize the expansion of inequalities.\n\nEverywhere, the pandemic is likely to takea disproportionate toll on the poor.For example, information from the Catalan regional authorities, in Spain, indicates that residents of poorer neighbourhoods may be six or seven times more likely to contract the virus than people in richer areas.\n\nThere is a strong need for governmental action to ensure income security, the protection of livelihoods, and access to essential goods and services for the poorest members of society. It is vital to prevent people from becoming homeless as a result of losing their jobs. Cash grants should be envisioned, alongside measures to ensure families can delay rental or loan payments, and a halt to evictions. For the homeless, and others without adequate housing, measures could include using short-term rentals and emergency accommodation.\n\nMy Office is currently compiling good economic and social practices adopted by countries in every region – many of them developing countries – and we will bring these to your attention. We will also be working to integrate human rights into all the work of the UN's economic and social programs.\n\n3.Protection of health-workersand their adequate remuneration should be a paramount concern. To note, 70% of the world's health-workers are women, many of whom may be facing the additional burdens I have noted.\n\n4. When an existential threat faces all of us, there isno place for nationalism or scapegoating– including of migrants and minority communities. There have been growing, and unacceptable, physical and verbal attacks on people of East Asian origin, and members of other minorities, and action should be taken to combat this. As a matter of fact, Westerners too are sometimes targeted for abuse, including in our missions.\n\n5. In every stage of this epidemic – including the recovery – efforts should be made to involveNational Human Rights Institutions, civil society activistsand human rights defenders. Those with long-standing involvement in economic and social rights, urban communities and specific vulnerable groups, such as indigenous peoples, have gained many valuable lessons that can benefit all policy-makers today.\n\n6. Any obstacle to medical efforts in one country heightens the risk for all of us. Sectoralsanctionswhich have negative impacts on health care and the human rights of vulnerable people should urgently be lifted or adapted, with effective humanitarian exemptions to ensure access to vital supplies.\n\n7. I commend the efforts underway to ensure the Human Rights Council can assist in a timely manner with COVID-related human rights concerns. Under your leadership, Madam President, the Council is resuming its work. In addition to this informal briefing, a series of e-meetings with various stakeholders is being planned, and I understand there are discussions regarding a special session on COVID-19. I have been grateful for the swift and pertinent analyses of many Special Procedures mandate holders and and Chairs of Treaty Bodies.\n\nThroughout the response and recovery stages of the epidemic, we must all step up and demonstrateglobal solidarity. In this context, I remind all States of the duty of international cooperation and assistance under Article 2 of the Convention on Economic, Social and Cultural rights.\n\nBefore concluding, I want to make a few remarks about recovery from this crisis.\n\nAs the Secretary-General has highlighted, we must build back better. No country was prepared for this shock, which in every State has been exacerbated by inequalities, particularly in access to health-care, social protections and public services.\n\nThe epidemic has clarified the need to increase our efforts toensure that all people, including the most vulnerable, benefit from development. We need to redouble efforts to build more inclusive and sustainable economies, and to shape societies that are more resilient in the face of shocks. The 2030 Agenda is fully mapped and universally approved: it remains our strongest tool.\n\nIt should also be clear thatprotecting the environment,ensuring biodiversity,is the best way to protect human health and wellbeing, including from pandemics. Environmental degradation and biodiversity loss create the conditions for the type of animal-to-human zoonosis that has repeatedly resulted in vital epidemics. Not only Covid-19 – you will remember SARS, MERS and Ebola are also a result of zoonosis, so we need to ensure respect for the environment.\n\nWe simply cannot return to where we were just a few months ago, before COVID-19.\n\nThis is a colossal test of leadership. It demands decisive, coordinated and innovative action from all, and for all.  We are physically distant today, but we must stand together.\n\nAll of you have received a letter informing you of the work being undertaken by my Office in the context of COVID-19, and I will provide regular updates to you as the situation evolves. I take this opportunity to publicly thank all my staff for their continued determination and work at this challenging time.\n\nThank you Madam President.\n\nFull video:https://vimeo.com/405809931\n\nThe Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) has createda webpagewith links to all its resources on COVID-19, as well as statements, press releases and articles by UN human rights mechanisms.\n\nOHCHR has also developed specific guidance relating to COVID-19, human rights and the socio-economic impact of the epidemic,available here."}]}

Nguyen Thuy Anh, Chairwoman of the National Assembly's Committee on Social Affairs;\n\nHis Excellency, Mr. Pham Quang Vinh, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs;\n\nExcellencies, Ambassadors;\n\nDistinguished colleagues from Government, the private sector and civil society partners;\n\nMembers of the UN Country Team and other colleagues from the United Nations family;\n\nLadies and Gentlemen,\n\nOn behalf of both the UN Country Team and the broader UN family in Viet Nam, please allow me to warmly welcome you to this UN Day commemoration and celebration. I wish to thank His Excellency Minister Tran Hong Ha both for gracing us with his presence and for his strong support for the UN in Viet Nam. I also wish to thank Her Excellency Mme. Chairwoman Nguyen Thuy Anh and our guest of honour, representing the Government of Viet Nam, the Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, His Excellency Pham Quang Vinh for their presences here today. It is an honour for us to celebrate UN Day with all three of them.\n\nUN Day marks the entry into force of the UN Charter 73 years ago today, on 24 October 1945, when the United Nations officially came into being.\n\nAnd, 73 years on, the United Nations remains even more relevant, significant and necessary in these challenging times for multilateralism, as our Secretary General just said last Friday to a global meeting of UN Resident Coordinators in New York from which I have just returned. How are we to tackle the major global challenges facing all nations of the world? How are we to generate opportunity, prosperity and hope for current and future generations, especially in these challenging times when narrow nationalisms and patriotisms are in resurgence as never before since they emerged in Europe just before the Second World War from whose ashes the United Nations was born?\n\nNo one size fits all, and every nation has its own story to tell, its lessons to impart, and its wealth to share. All of these are critical to addressing the substantial global challenges of our time. But we must all recognize that just like globalization, multilateralism is here to stay and grow. In fact, they are strange but essential bedfellows. Accelerated climate change and climate related disasters, dealing with protracted regional and national conflicts, harnessing rapid technological advances, as well as many other critical, cross-border or transnational issues shaping our world ALL require multilateral and global action and solutions.\n\nMultilateralism is therefore crucial to achieving our shared three pillars of the United Nations: peace and security, sustainable development, and human rights for all, in a manner consistent with the principles and aspirations of the UN Charter, which all 193 Member States of the United Nations have committed to. This year also marks the 70th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights proclaimed by the United Nations General Assembly in 1948.\n\nWhile the role of the UN has evolved since 1945 and must continue to do so to remain relevant in the 21st century to ensure the achievement of peace and security, the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda and the fulfilment of human rights for all human beings, its core and fundamental objectives remain the same, with the UN Charter remaining a timeless and inspirational document. Despite its many imperfections, which largely reflect the imperfections of its Member States, the United Nations is our only common global home. If it did not exist, we would have to reinvent it.\n\nThree critical agreements have recently been reached through the UN, and with the active participation of Viet Nam and all Member States here present. 1) The 2030 Agenda and its 17 Sustainable Development Goals, 2) the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, and 3) the Addis Ababa Agenda on Financing Sustainable Development. With these indispensable and interrelated accords, the world has given itself the tools to tackle major global challenges, together as global citizens, as well as within our own countries.\n\nDistinguished Guests,\n\nLadies and Gentlemen,\n\nIndeed, every nation has its story to tell. And, Viet Nam's own story is filled with precious lessons and invaluable wealth. War and peace, tragedy and joy, hardship and well-being. Viet Nam has had a unique set of experiences that continue to unlock the potential that has led to remarkable social and economic progress in this country in less than a generation. According to the Government of Viet Nam, approximately 7.3 million people were lifted out of multi-dimensional poverty in only five years between 2012 and 2017, an extraordinary achievement.\n\nThe UN in Viet Nam is both proud to have had the opportunity to contribute to such significant results and continues to see and share these experiences as valuable to other countries and regions of the world as we continually work to share best practices and build partnerships globally.\n\nViet Nam, I am happy to confirm, is a strong supporter of multilateralism. It has been substantively involved with the UN, including through the Security Council, the Economic and Social Council, the Human Rights Council, UNESCO's Executive Board, the UN International Law Commission, and most recently through its increased support for UN Peacekeeping Operations.\n\nViet Nam is also a leading advocate of the principles of multilateral cooperation at the regional level. The APEC meeting of 2017, the World Economic Forum on ASEAN of 2018, and Viet Nam's growing leadership role in ASEAN are testimony to this. It will Chair ASEAN again in 2020 and hopefully occupy a non-permanent seat in the UN Security Council again for 2020-2021 for which it has been put forward as the uncontested candidate from this region.\n\nAs partners to Viet Nam, as the United Nations, it is a privilege to serve in this unique and beautiful country.\n\nDistinguished Guests,\n\nOn the 73rd anniversary of the United Nations, we find ourselves at a crossroads, one where we can together shape the Organization to better support sustainable development through Agenda 2030 and the 17 Sustainable Development Goals. The Secretary General is leading the UN through ambitious reforms. These will substantially change the way the UN operates globally, regionally and at country level. The UN's peace and security pillar, its management arrangements, and its development system are all undergoing substantive changes as I speak, with the overarching objective of eradicating poverty in all its forms and achieving sustainable development.\n\nUN development system reform, the most significant in decades, which will formally go into effect on 1 January 2019, is not inward navel gazing, but is about becoming much more effective, coordinated, transparent and accountable, to better assist countries in implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. With 12 years of One UN experience and leadership, Viet Nam is uniquely placed to remain at the forefront of this new generation of UN development system reforms.\n\nAs the UN Country Team in Viet Nam present here, we are committed to implementing these reforms as agreed by all UN Member States through a UN General Assembly resolution on 31 May 2018. With the support of Viet Nam's leaders, and in collaboration with all partners, we will continue to strive for a United Nations which works for all, tirelessly striving to Leave No One Behind.\n\nThrough the UN and Government agreed \"One Strategic Plan\" for 2017-2021, our common partnership framework, the work of 18 UN entities operating in Viet Nam is brought together. My colleagues here, whom you know, represent these UN agencies, funds, programmes and specialized agencies. I wish to thank them, as the UN Resident Coordinator, for the dedicated service they are providing to the people of Viet Nam, together as a UN family.\n\nThe support currently provided by the UN family is focused on gender sensitive poverty reduction, social development and inclusive social services, good governance, justice and human rights, inclusive economic growth and social protection, as well as climate change, environmental sustainability and disaster risk reduction and more. The UN has been working in close collaboration with the Government of Viet Nam for over 40 years, and with the support of all of you here present, seeks to contribute to a Vietnamese society which is greener, healthier, better educated, and more inclusive and empowered to reach its full potential within the overall framework of the UN's 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\n\nAs stated by the Deputy Secretary General during the recently held 2018 UN General Assembly, \"At its core, the 2030 Agenda is a ground-breaking and inclusive global promise to eradicate poverty and achieve a better future for all on a healthy planet. Success will be measured in how well we live up to the commitment to leave no one behind. We need to ensure that we provide a voice and a platform for the most marginalized, vulnerable and excluded communities and individuals\".\n\nViet Nam can lead regionally and globally on the Sustainable Development Goals as it did on their predecessor Millennium Development Goals.\n\nLadies and Gentlemen,\n\nPlease allow me to conclude on this occasion by thanking, on behalf of the entire UN Country Team, the Government and people of Viet Nam for their excellent partnership with and support to the United Nations System, both within this country and beyond.\n\nWe are privileged to work with both the \"Whole of Government\" and the \"Whole of Society\" of Viet Nam.\n\nAs stated in the preamble of the United Nations Charter: \"We the peoples of the United Nations are determined to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person, in the equal rights of men and women and of nations large. We the peoples of the United Nations are determined to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom\".\n\nI thank you for joining us today in this commemoration and celebration of the 73rd anniversary of the founding of the United Nations.\n\nThank you! Xin Cảm Ơn!\n\nRelated resources:"}]}

Rahmadina in the Philippines was pregnant and married before she finished her first year of high school. Mukul in India was a married professional using contraception; she was shocked to discover she was five months pregnant less than a year after delivering her first child. And Yajaira [Ya-hai-ra] from El Salvador slept with her boyfriend just once; she had not received any sexuality education.\n\nThe State of World Population report 2022 shows that where data are available, nearly a quarter of all women are unable to say no to sex and unable to make decisions about their own health care.\n\nIs it any wonder then that nearly half of all pregnancies in the world are unintended – nearly half – amounting to 121 million pregnancies every year? For the women affected, the most life-altering reproductive choice – whether or not to become pregnant – is no choice at all.\n\nThe 2030 Sustainable Development Goals recognize women’s bodily autonomy and gender equality, and the importance of women's ability to make informed decisions about sexual relations, contraception and reproductive health care. When an estimated half of all pregnancies are not by choice, it gives us an alarming picture of the state of neglect of women’s reproductive freedom.\n\nYet this crisis is largely invisible, in part because it is so very common. It’s happening everywhere, including right here in the heart of Europe. Nearly everyone knows someone who has experienced an unintended pregnancy.\n\nOf course, just because they’re unintended doesn’t mean they are unwelcome: Many unintended pregnancies are met with joy. Many unplanned babies are deeply loved. Yet while celebrating fortunate outcomes, we must also acknowledge the denial of choice that gave rise to the pregnancies to begin with.\n\nAnd it would be wrong to ignore the unwelcome outcomes. Unwilling pregnancies leave women and girls struggling to deal with a situation they did not affirmatively choose, at a time they did not choose, under conditions they did not choose – or even with a partner they did not choose. You may be surprised to know that an estimated 60 per cent of unintended pregnancies are decidedly unwanted and end up in abortion, far too often unsafe abortion – a major driver of maternal deaths.\n\nSo why talk about this now? Why discuss pregnancy and women’s sexual and reproductive rights? The question is understandable… and deeply regrettable. It shows how easily the most fundamental rights of women and girls are pushed to the backburner, especially during times of crisis – precisely when they are at greatest risk of being sidelined. Our report shows how these rights are undermined in times of peace, and under assault in times of conflict and instability.\n\nYes, there are other issues competing for the headlines: horrors of conflict, COVID-19, climate change, vast displacements, racial injustice. None of these are standalone issues, and neither is unintended pregnancy. Our world is interconnected, and so are our catastrophes. Including the personal catastrophe of giving birth to a child without hope.\n\nWe saw this when pandemic “lockdowns” disrupted sexual and reproductive health services and contraceptive access and led, in some places, to increases in unintended pregnancies. We see it in humanitarian settings where women and girls face escalating risk of sexual violence. And we see it when women’s and girls’ bodies are not considered their own, which has impacts across societies. Unintended pregnancies are personal issues for the women affected, health issues for women, families and societies, and human rights issues for countries and the world.\n\nFor far too long, humanity has accepted this denial of women’s autonomy as normal. Whole systems – law, custom, traditions, family rules – continue to assign men control over women’s bodies and fertility. It was not until 1968 that the international community recognized the right of all people to freely choose the number and spacing of their children. And it was only in 1993 that marital rape was recognized as a violation of human rights.\n\nSince then, we have seen world leaders sign on to shared human rights principles and popular support for gender equality. There is also arguably better understanding that, in our interconnected world, the fates of the few impact the futures of the many. The marginalization of a few can spread misfortune across borders and generations. This is why the world committed to the Sustainable Development Goals.\n\nAs I’ve already said unintended pregnancy leads to maternal deaths. Our report reveals that rates of unintended pregnancy strongly correlate with gender inequality, with lower socioeconomic development, and with more restrictions on sexual and reproductive rights. It shows the steep costs associated with unintended pregnancy: worsened health, lost education, lost income and increased family hardships. Unintended pregnancy costs billions of dollars in increased health system expenditures, and worse outcomes for future generations.\n\nLet us not forget to stand up for the adolescent girl who, through ignorance about her body or lack of choice – or both – is condemned to a life of poverty when unintended pregnancy ends her education – her lifeline to a brighter future. Let us remember that the devastating ripple effects of crushing poverty don’t stop at that girl’s doorstep, nor at her country’s border. We are all poorer for it. Global development threatened, because of it.\n\nOver 250 million women desire to avoid pregnancy yet are not using a safe, modern method of contraception. Our systems, societies, leaders, governments and media are failing to recognize this as a crisis, one that has ramifications on the rights and welfare of people all across the world. Open your eyes; see the unseen. This is a wake-up call.\n\nOur report calls for a collective change in mindset to see the unseen, to acknowledge the unrealized value of women and girls, to ensure universal health coverage, end gender-based violence, and uphold sexual and reproductive rights, especially in crisis and humanitarian contexts.\n\nTo solve the problem of unintended pregnancy, we are calling on policymakers and community leaders to change priorities, to expand choices and resources for women and girls. Raise up the value of women and girls, listen to their voices, invest in the contraceptive services and information that they say they want and need – services that are stigma-free and supportive of bodily autonomy. Don’t just promise gender equality – model it in your actions.\n\nWe know these actions can produce real change. We see it in the lives of the girls I just mentioned. Mamusu, in Sierra Leone, is receiving the support she did not have as a girl, from a mentor with a local NGO, and she has been able to resume her education. She wants to become a nurse. Rahmadina is determined to give her daughter options that she did not have herself. And Yajaira is raising two boys to reject gender-unequal norms and speak openly about issues like contraception.\n\nYet the burden of addressing this crisis should not fall on the shoulders of the women who experience unintended pregnancy. That’s a responsibility that belongs to me, to you, to all of us. It is up to all of us to act.\n\nWe see action when governments commit to a dedicated budget line for family planning.\n\nWe see action when crisis responders take into account the sexual, reproductive and menstrual health and hygiene needs of women and girls stricken by disaster. These are essential, life-saving services.\n\nWe see it when faith partners promote access to comprehensive sexuality education. I urge more religious leaders to challenge the notion that there is somehow a conflict between faith and human rights, women’s rights.\n\nOnly when each of us has the power to make this fundamental decision about our health, bodies and futures will we be able to secure a more just, equitable and prosperous world."}]}

It is also a major threat to coastal nations currently enjoying economic benefits from fishing and aqua-culture.\n\nGlobally, up to 5 trillion plastic bags are used each year, and 1 million plastic bottles are bought every minute. 90% of bottle and tap water contain plastic particles. According to United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), it is estimated that in the next 10-15 years global plastic production is projected to nearly double.\n\nPlastic pollution across Asia is a major problem. In fact, 60% of all plastic that ends up in our oceans comes from only 6 countries in Asia, including Vietnam. Vietnam is among the top 5 countries responsible for the estimated 13 million tons of plastic dumped in our ocean every year. Single-use plastics is widespread and waste management capacity is limited in Vietnam, causing the rising burden from plastic waste to the environment and public health.\n\nIt is time to call for collective action from all of us to combat one of the great environmental challenges of our time: such collective action is needed from governments, the private sector, as well as citizens as consumers who need to take responsibility.\n\nGovernmentsshould lead by enacting strong policies to push for a more circular model of design and production of plastic waste. Robust legislation must be enacted to curb the production and use of unnecessary single-use plastics.\n\nThe private sectormust innovate, adopting business models that reduce downstream impacts of their products. Manufacturers have to take responsibility for the pollution that their products are causing today and make investments in sustainable product design.\n\nCitizensmust act as both consumers and informed citizens, demanding sustainable products and by adopting sensible consumption habits and at the same time exercising their buying power by refusing single-use plastics.\n\nIndividual actions alone cannot solve the plastic pollution problem and unprecedented actions must be taken. We need to rethink and better devise strategies to design, produce and use plastic products to:\n\nIn response to the increasing concern of plastic waste, the UN in Vietnam comprisingmore than 15 organizationstogether with representatives of approximately 25 embassies and international development partners started a Plastic Pollution Campaign and signed the Code of Conduct on Combatting Plastic Pollution on 4 June 2018.\n\nThe UN has taken immediate actions to show how this Code of Conduct can be implemented and make a difference. A UN Joint Action Plan was developed and led by the UN Anti-Plastic Waste Working Group with members from across agencies. UN joint actions have been undertaken in everyday practices in our Green One UN House in Hanoi:\n\nWe are committed to turn our offices into action sites of sustainable practices to combat plastic waste. It is a small contribution, but it shows all offices what can be done.\n\nThe UN is committed to work side-by-side with the Government of Vietnam, public institutions, the private sector and communities on plastic pollution through technical assistance, policy advice and capacity building. This issue will also be a joint-action agenda for this whole month as part of our commemoration of UN Day on 24th October.\n\nThe UN in Viet Nam also supports Viet Nam's regional initiative to tackle ocean plastic pollution which was announced by Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc at the G7 forum held in Canada and at the Global Environment Facility (GEF) Assembly in Da Nang in June this year.\n\nCombating plastic pollution is crucial to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), to which we all are committed. We encourage the government of Viet Nam to promote a holistic circular economy approach and strong policies to address plastic waste pollution, promote sustainable and responsible business for resource efficient and cleaner production, and ensure product design without pollutants.\n\nVietnam could, with appropriate policies, with businesses being pushed in the right direction through appropriate regulation, and public awareness leading to public pressure, go from being one of the world's main sources of plastic waste to being a driving force globally on innovative and comprehensive solutions.\n\nWe welcome MONRE's timely initiative on \"Anti-plastic waste Campaign\" to kick off the national campaign, calling for joint action from Vietnamese society to significantly reduce plastic waste and save our environment.\n\nThank you!

These meetings, including today's High-Level Symposium, provide an important platform for stakeholders and partners from APEC countries to discuss a wide range of development challenges that they are facing, opportunities for promoting free trade and investment, and encouraging strengthened economic and technical cooperation to further sustainable economic growth and prosperity in the APEC region, which accounts for 39% of the world's population and 59% of the world's nominal GDP. I strongly believe that the results of these meetings and the strengthened cooperation that will contribute to successful outcomes during the APEC Economic Leaders Week that will take place from 5 to 11 November 2017 in Da Nang. The theme of today's Symposium - \"Advancing Economic, Financial and Social Inclusion\" - is indeed important for enhancing sustainable economic growth and prosperity in APEC countries and in all countries around the world.\n\nInclusion is at the core of the UN and global community's 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and is well reflected in all the Sustainable Development Goals and their associated targets. It is also mirrored in the key Agenda 2030 principles of \"leaving no one behind\", and in its vision of a \"just, equitable, tolerant, open and socially inclusive world in which the needs of the most vulnerable are met\" in - \"a world in which every country enjoys sustained, inclusive and sustainable growth and decent work for all\".\n\nWhile many APEC countries have well-earned reputations for economic transformation and have accomplished substantial progress in poverty reduction and economic growth, the challenges ahead in sustaining this progress are significant and should not be under-estimated. While the number of people undernourished in the APEC region decreased from 304 million in 2005 to 185 million in 2015, governments not only need to support the poorest groups to escape poverty, but also need to ensure that the just-above-the-poverty-line population, sometimes referred to the \"missing middle\" or \"vulnerable middle\", does not fall back into poverty.\n\nIn the case of Viet Nam, where the country has achieved remarkable economic growth and poverty reduction over the last few decades, less than 10% of the population now consists of poor households, mostly located in ethnic minority or rural mountainous areas. In those areas, the government has implemented a series of targeted policies and programmes to help improve their income, and enable them to gain better access to basic social services and social protection. On the other hand, lower income groups, which remain vulnerable, have been growing consistently and constantly, and together with near-poor households now represent 75% of the Vietnamese population. These households' incomes are not sufficient to enable their families to be resilient to shocks, since they face difficulties in accessing decent jobs, health and education services and social protection, and are hence less able to become productive contributors to economic growth.\n\nThere is also evidence that economic growth is not necessarily translating into greater gender equality for all, and out of 600 million women who work in the Asia-Pacific labour force, only 30% of such working women are engaged in wage employment compared to almost 40% of working men. Recognizing the commitment of G20 leaders in 2014 to reduce the gender gap by 25% by 2025, we also need to acknowledge that women are in more vulnerable employment due to a larger share of them working as family workers with no independent access to income, having to nurture dependent children and the elderly, whose rapidly growing numbers add additional pressure on the economy. To achieve more sustainable development in the next stage of development, APEC emerging economies will need to create many more productive and decent jobs that require more advanced skills for all, especially for the \"missing middle\". This includes enhanced support to small-scale enterprises, and more investments in vocational training, higher education and critical thinking for all income groups to seize new productive employment opportunities and to enable creative, \"out of the box\" thinking and innovation.\n\nAllow me to highlight that inclusive growth also requires that both the poor and non-poor are full participants in the economy equitably sharing in all its benefits. This will not happen without their equitable participation in creating sustainable growth as well as their participation in associated decisions to organize the progression of growth and shape growth itself. The 2030 Agenda's Sustainable Development Goal 16 was created to promote a just, peaceful and inclusive society that will require the inclusion in societal processes of all citizens. It clearly conveys that all people should have opportunities to act as active members in their society, and participate in shaping the course of development and improving social cohesion. The importance of this goal cannot be over-emphasized.\n\nAllow me now to briefly focus on financial inclusion. It is important to note that while economic inclusion emphasizes everyone's right to participate in the growth process and benefit from its progress, financial inclusion is an important instrument and means to realize this vision.\n\nWhile the rate of adults who own bank accounts is at an 80% average in some APEC countries such as Malaysia, China and Thailand, the rate remains in the lower 30% for countries such as Mexico, Indonesia, the Philippines and Viet Nam. In these countries, the rate of households able to deposit savings in the formal banking systems remains low, as do the rates of borrowing from a formal bank. Despite the boom in IT, internet and mobile services, and increasing use of electronic devices in these countries, mobile payment, banking and electronic financial transactions remain modest. In 2015, less than 60% of people and households in developing APEC economies had access to a computer or the internet.\n\nUrgent action is needed to address issues of financial exclusion, which raise costs and restrict the supply of capital, weakens employment opportunities, limit small- and medium-sized enterprises that dominate the domestic private sector, and reduce investments in education. Legal and regulatory reforms are necessary to enable improved access and supply of financial services, and incentives are required for formal banking systems to do business with \"unbanked groups\" as well as with small and medium-sized enterprises. Countries will need to be ready to open the market to different types of innovative financial service providers to reach unbanked segments. In this regard, I am glad to announce that during the recent visit of the UN Secretary-General's Special Advocate for Inclusive Finance for Development, Her Majesty Queen Maxima of the Netherlands to Viet Nam, the Government informed key stakeholders and development partners that a Financial Inclusion Strategy is being prepared, which will identify a series of concrete actions in the aforementioned areas.\n\nLadies and Gentlemen,\n\nThe challenge of reducing inequalities, both within and across countries, needs to be tackled by joint efforts of all APEC partners, both developed and developing. As Nobel Laureate in Economics Dr. Joseph Stiglitz puts it: \"Inequality causes instability, increasing the frequency of big swings in the economy. Extremes of inequality mean that larger fractions of the population are in poverty, with a lower ability to cope with shocks when they occur. Extremes of economic inequality inevitably lead to political inequality; with the result that governments are less likely to provide the systems of social protection and services that can protect those at the bottom from the consequences of large shocks.\" We need to think of inequality not just as a moral issue, but also as a fundamental economic concern, integral to thinking about human development.\n\nI am pleased to have been part of the official launch of the Viet Nam National Action Plan to implement the 2030 Agenda in July 2017, which marks an important milestone for Viet Nam's active participation in the global 2030 Agenda journey and towards the fulfilment of its SDG commitment. It recognizes achieving greater inclusion and tackling inequalities as central to Viet Nam's development, and identifies actions and efforts to realize the VSDGs, including target 10.2 to \"[By 2030], empower and promote the political, economic and social inclusion of all citizens, irrespective of age, sex, disability, ethnic origin, nationality, religion, economic status or other conditions\". Furthermore, the Government of Viet Nam has recently announced that they will present their First Voluntary National SDG Review at the next UN High-Level Political Forum in New York in July 2018; a critical initiative that should be preceded by a National-level forum. I strongly believe that with its strong political commitment, determination and rich experiences in achieving the MDGs, and embarking on a new inclusive growth model, Viet Nam can achieve the SDGs and make strong progress in greater economic, financial and social inclusion.\n\nLadies and Gentlemen,\n\nLet me conclude by saying that the UN in Viet Nam, and in other APEC countries, stands ready to provide the technical, operational and programmatic support needed by governments to identify and implement feasible and innovative solutions to the challenges of improving economic, financial and social inclusion. I hope that through the fruitful discussions at this Symposium you will be able to identify sound solutions and concrete actions, including new forms of economic and technical cooperation, for advancing economic, financial and social inclusion nationally, regionally and globally to fully achieve the Sustainable Development Goals and the 2030 Agenda.\n\nXin Cảm Ơn!"}]}

Although I was not yet in Viet Nam at that time, I recognize the significance of the  International Conference “Strengthening Women’s Role in Building and Sustaining Peace: From Commitments to Results” hosted by the Government of Viet Nam in collaboration with the United Nations in Ha Noi, Viet Nam on 7 - 9 December, 2020. This event also  commemorated the 20th anniversary of the landmark UN Security Council Resolution 1325 and the establishment of the Women, Peace and Security (WPS) agenda.\n\nThree years have passed from that historical date, and today we gather again, to put our heads together for a SMART action plan on Women, Peace and Security. A plan that is SPECIFIC, MEASURABLE, ATTAINABLE, RESULT ORIENTED and TIME BOUND. This journey has demonstrated government’s commitment to implement the Hanoi Commitment to Action. The WPS NAP fulfills one of the Hanoi Commitments to Action, which is to “recognize the key role of Vietnamese women in achieving sustainable peace and development, whether as peacemakers, peacekeepers, peacebuilders, or as responders to crises, and commit to the promotion of gender equality, the empowerment of women and girls, and the realization of their human rights as an integral part of efforts to maintain international peace.”\n\nNational Action Plans for Women Peace and Security have helped 107 Member States to move towards a more inclusive, equal, and secure world for women and girls. In his opening remarks at the SECURITY COUNCIL ANNUAL OPEN DEBATE – WOMEN, PEACE AND SECURITY on 25 October 2023, the UN Secretary General conveyed four messages to member states. Let me share these with you:\n\nI congratulate Vietnam for taking this bold step forward. The four key objectives of Vietnam’s NAP –\n\nreflect aholistic approachto address the unique challenges for women in conflict and disaster situations, and also the unique strengths and contributions they bring to such situations.\n\nI thank the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for their coordination of this important process. There are over 230 participants from various backgrounds - international agencies, UN agencies, civil society organizations, academia, and local government representatives. This diverse gathering reflects the UN’s call for a whole of government and whole of society approach needed to make sustainable development a reality. Gender equality and security are critical goals and enablers of the SDGs.\n\nOn this journey, let us remember that we are not just shaping a document, but we are shaping the future of women and girls in Vietnam and the peace and security of this nation. At the UN, we are proud to be a part of this journey. Our commitment to gender equality, women's rights, and the Women, Peace, and Security agenda is unwavering. We commit to sustained support, recognizing that the success of this NAP will have far-reaching implications, not just for Vietnam but for the region and the world.\n\nThank you for your presence and engagement. I wish us all a productive workshop.\n\nXin CAM ON!"}]}

Let me at the outset thank the General Office for Population and Family Planning - GOPFP - for co-hosting and co-organizing today's celebration.\n\nWorld Population Day is celebrated across the world on 11 July to focus global attention to some of the most pressing population issues of our time. And today we mark World Population Day with the theme of \"Family Planning is a Human Right\".\n\nFifty years ago, on 13 May 1968, at the United Nations International Conference on Human Rights in Tehran, the world declared that \"parents have a basic human right to determine freely and responsibly the number and the spacing of their children.\". This was the first time that family planning had expressly been described in this way. The Tehran Proclamation emphasized the importance of choice for every human being – including, of course, for women, at a time when women's rights and gender equality were on the global agenda as never before.\n\nThen, in 1994, came another landmark moment, with the International Conference on Population and Development in Cairo, Egypt – the ICPD as we call it. From the ICPD came a Programme of Action that not only reiterated family planning as a basic human right, but expanded on that by spelling out exactly what was contained under the wider umbrella of sexual and reproductive health and rights. The ICPD Programme of Action has been a key platform for the work that UNFPA does across the world today, in more than 150 countries and territories.\n\nNow, since 2016, the Asia-Pacific region, including Viet Nam – along with the rest of the world – has embarked on the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, underpinned by the 17 Sustainable Development Goals, or SDGs. The Agenda and its Goals seek to achieve a life of dignity for all, in order to truly leave no one behind. This includes the fulfillment of the Tehran Proclamation, the ICPD Programme of Action and all other instruments that have gone before which enshrine rights and choice – including the original Declaration of Human Rights that marks its 70th anniversary this year.\n\nAt UNFPA, we have embarked on a new Strategic Plan which supports the 2030 Agenda and strengthens our commitment to the ICPD Programme of Action.\n\nOur Strategic Plan covers a lot of issues, but they can be broadly summarized under three Transformational Results for our region and our world:\n\nGlobally, some 214 million women in developing regions want to avoid or delay childbearing. Why, in this day and age, should they lack access to quality information, services and supplies, including modern contraception?\n\nAmong them are 6.3 million sexually active adolescent girls in Asia and the Pacific. Without fulfilling the rights of these precious young lives to access timely information and quality services, we will continue to have an estimated 3.6 million unsafe abortions among young women in our region every year.\n\nLack of information and services will have a profound impact on the health and lives of children, adolescents and adults, including fetal and neonatal deaths; cervical cancer; infertility; the risk of HIV; and physical, psychological and social consequences that can severely compromise the quality of life of those impacted.\n\nVoluntary family planning is central to gender equality and women's empowerment, and it is a key factor in reducing poverty. Achieving the world's Sustainable Development Goals by 2030 will depend significantly on how well the sexual and reproductive health and rights of women and young people are fulfilled. Catering to their unmet need for family planning is among the most cost-effective investments overall.\n\nUNFPA in Asia and the Pacific, including Viet Nam, is fully committed to supporting Governments to ensure that universal access to health, including sexual and reproductive health, will become a reality for all. But, we cannot do this alone. Governments, parliamentarians, the private sector and civil society must join forces to make it happen.\n\nAnd we need young persons, including those of you here today to be involved strongly in this effort. We often hear that \"young people are the future\" – but how often do we truly involve young persons in helping shape their own futures?\n\nThis includes providing genuinely comprehensive sexuality education at a young age, serving as a foundation for sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights – including family planning.\n\nTogether, by building partnerships between governments and civil society across Asia and the Pacific and globally, we can build a future where zero is the only acceptable number: zero maternal deaths, zero unmet demand for family planning, and zero violence and harmful practices against women and girls.\n\nInvestments in family planning today are investments in the health and well-being of millions of girls, women and young persons for generations to come.\n\nThank you, and wishing you all health, happiness and success this World Population Day – and always.\n\nXin cam on."}]}

Hence, your presence in this meeting is appreciated and will be useful for us to discuss the progress made thus far as well as for us to identify and assess crucial findings and recommendations and identify the way forward to ensure a shock-resilient, inclusive social protection system for Viet Nam.\n\nI am especially grateful that we were able to gather face-to-face today, given the COVID-19 circumstances. COVID-19 has also been a reason for a partial repurposing of this joint UN programme’s activities in 2020 to provide rapid support to the government in support of social protection response to the COVID-19 shock.\n\nThis Joint Programme is a UN initiative emanating from the global Joint SDG Pooled Fund made possible by UN member states and an EU contribution. It is an innovative global mechanism established to enable the United Nations to address the challenges of our time and support joint programmes in countries in order to drive transformation, systemic policy shifts and to deliver solutions that accelerate SDG progress and yield social impact across the whole spectrum of the SDGs with the spotlight on vulnerable groups left behind.\n\nAmong the different streams under this Joint SDG Fund, this particular Joint Programme on Social Protection was initially earmarked equally for 30 countries for a total amount of US$60 million with emphasis on the most vulnerable and marginalized people such as children, women, adolescents, people living with disabilities, and older persons. Viet Nam was provided with US$2 million from this joint fund stream to implement this joint programme during 2020-2021.\n\nThe UN Viet Nam Joint Programme which was made possible by this Global Joint SDG Fund contributed by Member States, international organizations, the private sector and philanthropic individuals including Sweden, Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Switzerland, Denmark, Luxemburg, Germany, Ireland, Monaco, Portugal, and the European Union together contributed the US$290 million agreed in the UN General Assembly's approved Resolution on UN Development System Reform. This is a testimony and embodiment of Member States’ commitments to international cooperation and global solidarity that is now needed more than ever before.\n\nThis Global Joint SDG Fund project on social protection in Viet Nam involves four UN agencies: ILO, UNICEF, UNFPA and UNDP, under my leadership as Resident Coordinator. It is jointly implemented with the Ministry of Labour, Invalids and Social Affairs as the key national implementing partner to help reform and bring coherence to the social protection system. Our work with government partners focuses on the importance of the life-cycle approach which, if implemented, can provide comprehensive social protection to the people of Viet Nam. Our agencies work on system change in policy design and social assistance programming and they will soon present and share their experiences with you during our meeting this morning. But let me assure you that UN agencies are jointly implementing a programme that advocates for the quality expansion of social protection coverage so that every child, every mother, every elderly person and every worker can benefit.\n\nAllow me to reiterate and emphasize that the results we have achieved so far must be built on not only in 2021 but well beyond that time, and that we need to redouble our efforts with more ambitious goals and commitments to accelerate SDG achievement as we recover from COVID-19.\n\nOn behalf of the UN Country Team and especially four participating UN agencies, I wish to acknowledge the support from your countries as well as our implementing partners from different departments of MOLISA and other national agencies such as the Viet Nam Women’s Union, Viet Nam Social Security and Ministry of Planning and Investment. I also call for your continued commitment and partnership.\n\nThe following presentations and plenary discussions on the joint programme should provide you with details of the results achieved and provide real human interest stories. Please view this event as merely a start. We expect more positive results and positive human stories as the programme progresses.\n\nThank you for being here with us today. Xin cảm ơn!"}]}

We had one joint event today with the Government, with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at the Diplomatic Academy where we were represented by the Chair of the Governance Results Group and which I am told went well. But given this special occasion, we felt it was important to have an event just with UN staff as well.\n\nI am very pleased to be here with you today to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights proclaimed and adopted on 10 December 1948.\n\nThrough the vision and resolve of drafters from across the globe, this Declaration established the notion of universal human rights for the first time in an international document. Indivisible rights, spanning civil and political as well as economic, social and cultural rights, were afforded to everyone simply by virtue of their being part of a humanity bound together in solidarity.\n\nThe commitment made by all States by adopting this Declaration was a mighty achievement, setting out a comprehensive and high standard for every State to respect and protect a standard of human rights below which no State should fall.\n\nThe Declaration laid down the fundamental principle, simple and powerful, that \"all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights\". This principle has subsequently been affirmed in a number of human rights instruments.\n\nOf course, human rights were not, once and for all, fully protected and respected with this Declaration. But national constitutions and legislative frameworks in the world have nevertheless seen major positive developments since the adoption of the Declaration with a growing emphasis on the progressive realization of human rights.\n\nProgress has been achieved through the agreement, signing, ratification and coming into legal force of subsequent international human rights Conventions, changed national laws to make domestic legislation consistent with international obligations committed to by UN member states in these Conventions, in addition to improved institutional frameworks to protect and promote the rights contained in the Declaration.\n\nPositive developments, however, continue to be offset by a number of enduring challenges such as violence and crises, shrinking space for freedom of speech and civil society, the impact of climate change on the enjoyment of rights, lack of access to basic social services and growing social inequalities, not just in wealth or income but also of opportunity, especially impacting vulnerable groups. As if that was not enough, discrimination, disempowerment and other human rights violations continue to pose formidable challenges.\n\nWith concern for human rights currently clearly in retreat in many contexts across the world, we need to highlight and advocate for the principles of this Declaration now more than ever. Though it is 70 years old today it is as relevant for the future of our society, as it was in 1948 and over the last seven decades.\n\nRecently, here in Viet Nam, especially in 2018, we have engaged extensively with a number of human rights mechanisms, all tracing back to the Universal Declaration as their mothership. We have also supported the Government, civil society and Embassies to engage with these mechanisms, for example, the UNCT has presented its reports on the 3rd UPR which Vietnam will go through next month in January 2019, as well as its reviews under the Convention on Torture and the ICCPR and our UN reports on each have significantly informed each of these processes. This is important, and I am very supportive of the engagement of UN agencies through our UN Country Team's Human Rights Thematic Group whose work has been very impressive and whom I wish to comment on this occasion.\n\nBut human rights work should not only be viewed as the work of this group or the Governance Results Group but of all UN staff. Our work on the rights enshrined in this Declaration should not be limited to our work with human rights mechanisms. We must use this Declaration and human rights instruments as a compass guiding us in all our work in support of achieving the 2030 Agenda as well as in our endeavor to leave no one behind. Unlike the Millennium Development Goals (the MDGs), human rights are at the core of and cut across all the Sustainable Development Goals. This is one of the important differentiating issues between the MDGs and the SDGs.\n\nOn this important anniversary of the Declaration, we should also be reminded of the very purpose of the United Nations, outlined in the first article of the UN Charter: \"promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all\". A purpose, which remains at the forefront of UN work through, among other goals, SDG 16 on Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions as well as initiatives such as the previous UN Secretary General's \"Human Rights Up Front\".\n\nAs the UN in Viet Nam, we must continue to work to further human rights. We must further our collective efforts to achieve development with equity through a rights-based and people-centred approach focused on achieving the SDGs and empowering the most marginalized segments of society. We must continue to work in a manner recognizing the universality, indivisibility, interdependence and interrelationship of all rights.\n\nWhile we recognize that this work will never be fully completed, with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and the Human Rights mechanisms and principles it has subsequently engendered, the world can be seen to have attained a relatively high normative standard against which all UN Member and Observer States should be held accountable in terms of their actions and those of their citizens.\n\nWhile doing so, we can find comfort in the fact that, despite the current challenges, historically, over the past 70 years, we have seen significant progress in the area of human rights. This is in substantial part because of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the work we do collectively as the UN, globally, regionally and at the country level.\n\nAs the UN in Viet Nam, we have a duty to keep upholding and defending these rights. In the words of former Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon: \"Let us ensure that those people who most need their rights protected are made aware that this Declaration exists — and that it exists for them.\"\n\nToday, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights is the most translated text in the world, available in more than 500 languages from Abkhaz to Zulu, making it a truly universal document. We must continue our work to make sure that these universal rights also become living reality for every human being, everywhere.\n\nThank you all so much for coming together to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and for your tireless work to ensure that no one is left behind.\n\nThank you! Xin cảm ơn!"}]}

Le Thi Thu Hang;\n\nDirector-General of United Nations Office at Geneva, Mrs. Tatiana Valoyava;\n\nVice President of Viet Nam Women’s Union, Mrs. Tran Lan Phuong\n\nFounder & President of Association of Swiss Women and Empowerment, Mrs. Victoria Dzodziev\n\nDistinguished Guests, Colleagues and Partners,\n\nLadies and Gentlemen,\n\nI am privileged to join you today to celebrate the invaluable contributions of Vietnamese women to the SDGs. The exceptional women featured in this “17 Faces of Action for the Sustainable Development Goals” Exhibition serve as an inspiration to us all.  Recognizing their achievements on National Vietnam Women’s Day is both timely and meaningful.\n\nThis year is a critical time for the SDGs. “Leave no one behind” is the defining principle of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. It is a shared promise by every country to work together to secure the rights and well-being of everyone on a healthy, thriving planet. But halfway to 2030, that promise is in peril. The SDGs are disappearing in the rear-view mirror, as are the hopes and rights of current and future generations.\n\nAs a global community, we are failing to translate this promise into action. When the UN Secretary-General, Mr António Guterres, visited Viet Nam last year, he did not speak about accelerating the SDGs. He spoke about saving them.\n\nWe all know how the COVID-19 pandemic reversed gains made towards sustainable development globally. To illustrate:\n\nAt the same time, there is also reason to remain hopeful. Hope in times of difficulty is sometimes called ‘radical hope’. Radical hope allows us to envision a better world for ourselves and our children – a world that is possible, not promised and not guaranteed. As such, hope calls for action. Humankind, together and against all odds, will rise to the occasion. For me, this exhibition showcases just that – hope.\n\nTo remain hopeful, we also need to feel inspired. The celebration of 17 remarkable women who have dedicated their lives to a better future is a source of inspiration. This exhibition shows women as entrepreneurs, professors, innovators, and community leaders. As scientists, advocates, environmental protectors, peacekeepers, and diplomats. These women are drivers of sustainable development – in their communities, in Viet Nam and beyond. It shows the great diversity of action needed to realize the SDGs. It also provides a compelling argument for the importance of an enabling environment in which everyone can actively participate and contribute.\n\nOne way of creating this enabling environment is to expand investments in gender equality and women’s empowerment. Investing in gender equality is one of the most powerful accelerators of sustainable development. Gains in gender equality improve all other sectors of society. IMF estimates that closing the gender gap can increase a country’s GDP by an average of 35%. The inclusion of women is therefore key to unlocking Viet Nam’s sustained economic growth, achieve high-income status by 2045, while accelerating SDG progress.\n\nTo the 17 remarkable women featured in this exhibition – I say thank you. May your actions continue to serve as inspiration.Thank you!"}]}

The Government of Viet Nam has issued National Plans of Action on Combating and Preventing Human Trafficking every 5-year since 2005. In particular, the 4th NPA for the period of 2021-2025, with a vision to 2030, is a cornerstone of the national efforts.\n\nThe revision of the 2011 Law on Human Trafficking Prevention and Combat also marks an important milestone. This revision provides a stronger foundation for addressing complex trends in trafficking in persons, which are exacerbated by socio-economic challenges.\n\nIn addition, increased attention to investigation and identification of various forms of trafficking helps to vastly improve identification and assistance to victims – a clear demonstration of Government’s commitment to streamlining inter-agency coordination and referrals, as well as implementing a whole-of-government approach.\n\nChallenges remain, however.\n\nYoung people of today face a dual-edged reality in the fight against trafficking. As digital natives, young people are increasingly vulnerable to traffickers who exploit online platforms to prey on them.\n\nHowever, young people also hold the power to drive significant changes. Their dynamism, creativity, and tech-savviness uniquely position them to develop innovative solutions to combat trafficking in the digital age.\n\nThis year, the theme for the World Day Against Trafficking in Persons is -- “Leave No Child Behind in the Fight Against Human Trafficking.” The theme underscores the importance of inclusive efforts to protect children, including through addressing risk and vulnerability, enhancing resilience, and strengthening protection.\n\nAccording to UNODC’s Global Trafficking in Persons Report, one in three victims of human trafficking globally is a child – although in some regions the proportion is much higher – and children are twice as likely as adults to face violence while being trafficked.\n\nFindings from IOM’s joint research with Harvard University show that no age group, gender, or nationality is immune. In more than 50 per cent of cases, family members or friends are involved.\n\nWe must unite to tackle these challenges, beginning with the engagement of youth in crafting key advocacy messages for human trafficking prevention campaigns. Let’s act now to create a supportive environment for youth-led advocacy. Young people can drive social and behavioural change. We must assist them in realizing their full potential delivering on the promise of migration.\n\nThe upcoming Summit of the Future in New York offers a chance to discuss important issues shaping our today and tomorrow, including on migration. At the Summit, there will be a strong focus on youth and future generations.\n\nThe Pact of the Future provides an opportunity for concrete, action-oriented commitments towards strengthening the meaningful participation of young people in decision-making at all levels. The Summit also aims to ensure that the positive contributions of migrants are recognized; and that regular migration is promoted to address the drivers of irregular migration, while ensuring the safety, dignity, and human rights of all migrants.\n\nOn behalf of the United Nations in Viet Nam, I congratulate all of you – changemakers leading IOM’s initiatives for safe migration and human trafficking prevention programme. With your vigilance and innovation, we are already fighting against trafficking.\n\nInitiatives like the “Migration Diary” at Do Luong 4 High School, drawing contests, interactive games and online communications campaigns, have mobilized participation of thousands of community members and reached more than 255,000 people. These impressive numbers prove the transformative power of youth in combating human trafficking\n\nLet us continue to harness the creativity, energy, and resolve of Vietnamese youth to confront these complexities of the digital age.\n\nBy investing in education, empowering through knowledge and skills, and championing young people’s initiatives, we can confront immediate threats. Young people can and are already inspiring the global movement for transformative change.\n\nTogether, we can turn the tide against trafficking in persons. We can build a future where every child can thrive in safety and dignity.\n\nThank you."}]}

I'm personally very pleased to see this conference happen since I was the one who raised the need for it with him as an important and necessary step towards ensuring a coherent long-term strategy for Viet Nam's global peacekeeping efforts.\n\nI would also like to especially welcome the participation of three important expert representatives from overseas: one from the Integrated Training Service – UN Department of Field Services who is based in Uganda, another from the Police Division of the UNDPKO based in New York, and a third expert from the Capacity Building Assistance Office, International Policy Division, Japanese Ministry of Defence. They have all travelled long distances to join us today. I would like to thank them for doing so.\n\nWe are here today, first of all, to appraise and express our warm congratulations on the recent impressive effort of Viet Nam in its global peacekeeping efforts. In the period 2014-2018, Viet Nam has deployed 29 turns of officers as liaison officers, military staff officers, intelligence collection analysts and military observers to South Sudan and Central African Republic including two military advisers who left this week. In 2017, Viet Nam sent its first female officer, Major Do Thi Hang Nga, to join the UN peacekeeping mission in South Sudan. This was a positive step by Viet Nam, in line with UN Security Council Resolution 1325 on women, peace, and security. And last but not least, on 1 October 2018, 63 doctors, nurses and technicians, including a number of women, were deployed together with the Level 2 Hospital to South Sudan. Viet Nam is obviously contributing more and more significantly to global peacekeeping.\n\nIn parallel with this increased effort by Viet Nam, on behalf of the UN and UNDP in Viet Nam, I was pleased to receive the request from the Ministry of National Defence Viet Nam last year for support on peacekeeping, including on establishing appropriate legal frameworks, as well as to facilitate Vietnamese deployment to peacekeeping missions, and build the capacity of Viet Nam's Department of Peacekeeping Operations to provide quality training to Vietnamese troops and those of other countries.\n\nOur cooperation was formalized in a meeting between Vice Minister of National Defence, Sr. Lt. Gen. Nguyen Chi Vinh and UN Assistant Secretary General Haoliang Xu of UNDP in New York on 13 October 2017. At the meeting UNDP agreed to support the Government of Viet Nam in the following areas:\n\nCapacity building for participation in UN Peacekeeping missions.\n\nSupport with resource mobilization and coordination from international and national development partners\n\nLong-term strategic advice and support for Viet Nam to develop the VNDPKO Training Center to become a regional centre.\n\nTo follow-up on this positive momentum, the UN in Viet Nam has been pleased to work with UNDPKO to prepare an advanced draft of a strategic advisory paper that Brig. Gen. Farooque Choudhury (retired from the Bangladesh Military but now a senior UN DPKO official) from DFS – UNDPKO will present later in some detail. I would like to echo the appreciation of VM Vinh for the paper because I strongly believe that this paper, for the first time, provides key findings, analysis and recommendations for improving the capacity of Viet Nam to participate in global peacekeeping, in the most strategic and comprehensive manner. UN member states and other members of the international community who are providing support to Viet Nam in this area are encouraged to read this paper and to coordinate more closely with the UN in Viet Nam to ensure that their support to Viet Nam on peacekeeping is more coherent, holistic, strategic, efficient and sustainable in the medium to long-term.\n\nI hope that the conference will lead to fruitful discussions around important themes to support Viet Nam's strategy on global peacekeeping including but not limited to: Gender and the Prevention of Sexual Exploitation and Abuse; UN recruitment policies including those on rotation, remuneration packages, and coordination of international support; language training, as well as partnership mechanisms to support Viet Nam.\n\nOn this occasion, I would also like to express our pleasure to learn about the initial steps taken by Viet Nam's public security sector and their willingness to consider committing their forces to global peacekeeping. In the coming days, the UN Police representative here from New York will conduct bilateral meetings with the Ministry of Public Security to have discussions on the potential for and best manner in which productive preparations can take place in Viet Nam prior to their sending police for peacekeeping missions.\n\nFinally, I wish to reiterate the commitment of the UN in Viet Nam to continue to support the Government of Viet Nam in this important area. We look forward to strong coordination and cooperation with UN member states and other partners as we move forward in this critical area for global peace and security.\n\nThank you. Xin Cam on."}]}

It is special because Viet Nam is marking 30 years of the national response to HIV with already many remarkable achievements but also with a view to achieving an even more ambitious goal of ending AIDS by 2030. It is also special because we are fighting two overlapping epidemics – HIV and COVID-19.\n\nI would like to take this opportunity to congratulate Viet Nam’s success thus far in controlling COVID-19 under the leadership of the Government and with the dedication of all healthcare workers fighting at the forefront against the virus. Viet Nam has also been quick and decisive in introducing innovative and flexible policies to ensure uninterrupted access to essential HIV services in the period of the COVID-19 outbreak for people living with HIV and other key HIV affected populations. For this, I salute the leadership and welcome the timely actions of the Viet Nam Authority for HIV/AIDS Control (VAAC).\n\nLooking back at the journey of 30 years of responding to HIV and AIDS in Viet Nam, it is amazing how the lives of people living with and at higher risk of contracting HIV and AIDS have changed over this period.\n\nAs a result of Viet Nam’s strong political commitment and leadership in the HIV response, treatment is now available upon diagnosis of HIV for all people living with the virus. HIV prevention approaches including innovative pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and opioid substitution therapy (OST) are also in the process of being impressively scaled-up and all options for HIV testing including community-led and self-testing are now available, with communities most affected by HIV making increasingly greater and more meaningful contributions to the national HIV response including, and in particular, through the fight against HIV-related stigma and discrimination.\n\nEarlier this year, Viet Nam approved the National Strategy to End AIDS by 2030 in additions to approving amendments to the Law on HIV/AIDS, with the aim of better protecting the right to access to HIV services for all people in need and greater sustainability of the national HIV response.\n\nViet Nam has been leading by example in embracing innovations as well as evidence-based and pragmatic approaches in the response to HIV in this region.\n\nYour efforts in controlling the HIV epidemic also contribute significantly to the achievement of other Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) including the SDGs on gender equality, reducing inequalities and partnerships for achieving the goals, among others.\n\nPlease accept my warm congratulations for all of Viet Nam’s remarkable achievements in responding to HIV and AIDS over the last 30 years that Viet Nam can clearly be proud of, including during this challenging year of 2020!\n\nI would also like to recognize and sincerely appreciate the hard work of the health and HIV and AIDS authorities and workers in all cities and provinces, as well as of the hundreds of social and community-based organizations, of people living with HIV and key HIV populations and communities, academia and development partners. The achievements I have mentioned above could not have become reality without all of you and the great solidarity and shared responsibility that you have demonstrated over the years.\n\nColleagues and friends,\n\nAs we approach the end of 2020, the world and Viet Nam are still at risk of a new wave of the pandemic and the news from HCMC last night was not good in this respect and should make us more careful - and Viet Nam has also and remains heavily impacted in socio-economic terms by COVID-19. More than ever, we need the strength of solidarity and shared responsibility to protect the right to health of all people, especially those who are most vulnerable and have been left behind, if we are to keep the HIV and AIDS response on track and achieve the goal of ending AIDS in Viet Nam by 2030.\n\nThe stakes remain high. Only by putting people at the centre, further promoting human rights and evidence-based HIV responses, acting together with continued strong leadership, commitment and by leveraging everyone’s potential to make a difference—the Party, parliamentarians, Government, communities of people living with and affected by HIV, community health workers, service providers, social organizations, private sector, other development partners—can new milestones and gains be achieved.\n\nIf it acts together with even greater solidarity and shared responsibility, Viet Nam can keep its promise to leave no one behind and end AIDS as a public health threat by 2030, thereby significantly and positively contributing to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals. The last miles are always the most difficult in any journey, but together we can make this happen.\n\nBy continuing to pursue a whole-of-society approach in this area, Viet Nam can remain at the forefront for the HIV response in the region, sharing its rich experience on how to leave no one behind with the region and the world. This experience has not only been a tremendous force for change and changed the course of HIV and AIDS in Viet Nam but has also demonstrated that it is possible to achieve Universal Health Coverage and many of the Sustainable Development Goals even for lower middle income countries.\n\nPlease be assured that the United Nations will continue to remain by your side on this journey leading to the end of AIDS in Viet Nam by 2030!\n\nAs the UN Secretary-General has said in his speech for World AIDS Day this year, let today be a reminder of the need to maintain focus on a global pandemic that is still with us nearly 40 years after it emerged and let us recognize that, to overcome COVID-19 and end AIDS, the world must stand in solidarity and share responsibility.\n\nI would like to thank everyone for your contributions to this journey so far and encourage you to keep the faith for its last remaining miles till 2030.\n\nI thank you for listening. Xin cam on va chuc suc khoe."}]}

The Government of Viet Nam has issued National Plans of Action on Combating and Preventing Human Trafficking every 5-year since 2005. In particular, the 4th National Plan of Action for the period of 2021-2025, with a vision to 2030, is a cornerstone of the national efforts.\n\nThe revised Law on Human Trafficking Prevention and Combat in 2024 is also a landmark achievement. It strengthens the legal framework to address the evolving nature of trafficking in persons and reinforces a whole-of-government approach that better prioritizes victim protection, inter-agency coordination, and survivor-centred justice.\n\nThese efforts by Viet Nam to promote safe migration and prevent human trafficking deserve high praise.\n\nNow, let us look at the challenges.\n\nAcross the Asia–Pacific region, trafficking in persons has become more complex. Following the COVID-19 pandemic, Southeast Asia has witnessed a sharp rise in scam compounds operated by transnational criminal groups. They employ sophisticated online schemes to commit large-scale fraud.\n\nAccording to IOM’s Regional Situation Report on Trafficking in Persons into Forced Criminality in Online Scamming Centres, the number of trafficking victims forced into criminal activities, who received IOM’s support in Southeast Asia, more than tripled, from 296 in 2022 to 1,093 so far in 2025.\n\nThe profile of these victims is changing. They are young. They are educated. At least 50% hold university degrees. Lured by promises of high-paying jobs, they end up having their passports confiscated, be subjected to confinement, violence, sexual abuse and coercion into carrying out scams.\n\nThis is the new trend in human trafficking: highly organized, transnational, and increasingly shifting into digital space.\n\nBut there is hope. And that hope is sitting right here in this room.\n\nLast year, I had the opportunity to engage with some of the young changemakers leading IOM’s efforts to promote safe migration and combat human trafficking.\n\nOne year on, I am proud to learn that through 14 impactful initiatives, your work has directly reached over 11,800 individuals and engaged more than 780,000 people online, an inspiring testament to your dedication and determination to prevent this crime.\n\nFrom virtual escape rooms game to AI-powered applications, I am truly encouraged by your plans to leverage technology more strategically in amplifying messages on safe migration.\n\nOn behalf of the United Nations in Viet Nam, I also extend my sincere congratulations to you all. Your creativity, energy and digital fluency position you to develop innovative solutions to combat trafficking in the digital age. Investing in youth not only protects their peers but also strengthens community resilience.\n\nThis year’s theme underscores the need to dismantle trafficking networks through coordinated law enforcement and justice sector responses while ensuring that survivors are fully protected.\n\nThis October, Viet Nam will host the signing ceremony of the Hanoi Convention against Cybercrime, the first-ever global treaty dedicated to addressing cybercrime. The event will mark a pivotal moment in international cooperation against cyber-enabled crimes, including human trafficking.\n\nOnce again, we are reminded that the future of this endeavour lies in collaboration, innovation, partnership, and youth leadership. We cannot end human trafficking without the contribution of each of you here today.\n\nTogether, we stand united in confronting these challenges, supporting victims, holding perpetrators accountable, and striving for a world where no one is bought, sold, or exploited.\n\nLet us continue to harness the creativity, energy, and determination of Vietnamese youth to tackle the complexities of the digital age.\n\nTogether, we can turn the tide against trafficking in persons. We can build a future where every person thrives in safety and dignity.\n\nThank you. Xin cảm ơn."}]}

It has taken me to the most interesting places around your great country. Thank you for ensuring that I can also learn from Dien Bien Province.\n\nThis year, the National Action Month focuses on protection, empowerment and prevention of violence against women and girls. More specifically, this calls for greater investments in the prevention of violence against women and girls. The National Action Month aligns with the Global 16 Days of Activismwhich runs from 25 November – the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women – and ends on 10 December – Human Rights Day – as a reminder that violence against women and girls is a grave violation of human rights.\n\nLet me provide a snapshot –\n\nGlobally, one in three women has been subjected to violence at least once in their lives. Every hour more than five women or girls are killed by their family member. 85% of women have witnessed online violence against another woman, and 38% have experienced it personally.\n\nIn Viet Nam, 63% of married women aged 15-64 have experienced some form of violence by their husband or intimate partner. Amongst these, half kept silent and did not seek help. Violence against women is costing the country roughly 1.8 per cent of the GDP per year.Women who experience violence earn an average of 35% less than those who are not subject to abuse.\n\nThis is an extraordinarily high price to pay. For the women and girls most importantly. But also for our societies as a whole.\n\nLadies and gentlemen,\n\nThere is much to be done. And we can all play our part; actively.\n\nAs the UN family in Viet Nam, we have joined forces and forged a partnership between the Governments of Viet Nam and Australia, together with the Ministry of Labour, Invalids and Social Affairs, the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism and selected provinces. One is Dien Bien. The aim is to roll out evidence-based strategies to reduce violence against women and children at home, in public, and online. UN agencies also work with strengthening the child protection system and with HIV/AIDS Response.\n\nAs leaders and representatives of Dien Bien,you have a vital role in investing in prevention of violence. Prevention costs cents on the dollar. And its return is manifold and manifest at all levels of society.\n\nI also want to stress your vital role in promoting diversity and ensuring everyone’s equal opportunity. Viet Nam is a multi-ethnic country with 54 officially recognized ethnic groups, of which 53 are ethnic minority groups. These include a wealth of diversity in terms of languages, origins, and religions. Many of these communities call Dien Bien their home. Across the country, we know that the living conditions of ethnic minorities – in particular of ethnic minority women and children – are consistently worse than the national average.\n\nAs individuals,I want to inspire you with three easy actions we can all integrate into our daily lives:\n\nI want to commend Dien Bien Province for your commitment to this important work and for organizing this event as a platform to connect and unite our collective efforts. I hope that the province will continue along this path to ensure that no woman or girl in Dien Bien is subject to violence.\n\nLet’s UNITE – for a better and equal planet for our children and the next generations to come.\n\nThank you! Xin cam on!"}]}

Both our children graduated from UNIS in New York many years ago and they and we lived and breathed UNIS New York’s very unique environment for 8 years!\n\nToday is a special moment in your lives, when you have time to pause and look back, reflect and take pride in the work that you’ve accomplished in the company of your parents, teachers and the many others who have supported you and contributed to your success as young adults.\n\nI would like to congratulate each one of you graduating here today from an academically challenging international baccalaureate programme that embodies the UN ideals of protecting human rights, eradicating poverty, combatting climate change impacts, and resolving conflicts, while advancing dignity, justice and equality for all people, and leaving no one behind. The richness and diversity of the profiles of the 80 students from 22 nationalities who are graduating here today from UNIS gives us all hope for a future of enhanced cooperation between peoples and nations across the boundaries of language, culture and nationality – something you are already used to living in your current day-to-day lives!\n\nYour journey so far could not have succeeded without the tremendous love and support of your families, who have encouraged and brought you to this critical juncture in your lives. Please join me in acknowledging with your applause your parents, teachers, friends and family members assembled here to witness your graduation, without whom you would not have travelled so far.\n\nLadies and Gentlemen,\n\nGraduating Class of 2019,\n\nYou are very lucky to be international students who have come of age in a global era where you have more opportunities and means to publicly voice your opinions, and to be heard, compared with any other generation before yours. You have already learned how to be global explorers and are used to making friendships across the boundaries of language, culture and nationality. UNIS’ main goal has always been to provide an educational and intellectual experience for its students, while celebrating diversity, and promoting cross-cultural exchange emphasizing three key values: holistic learning; embracing a diverse and inter-connected learning community; and ensuring individual and collective responsibility.\n\nHere at UNIS, you would have understood this better than other students in other schools almost anywhere in the world, because of the exposure you have had to the UN’s 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The 2030 Agenda, which promotes action to end global poverty, protect the planet and ensure that all people can enjoy peace and prosperity, is more important than ever and you should view yourselves as young UN ambassadors being sent out into the world to spread this message. I hope you will take these and other key UN values such as tolerance and respect for universal human rights with you wherever you go when you leave this Assembly Hall for the last time today.\n\nIn many ways, the UNIS graduating class of 2019 is already living these values and I can see this from your accomplishments. Many of you not only performed on stage in musicals, choirs, orchestras, and theatrical dramas, competed in countless athletic contests, including three Championship Matches, but you have also written your own plays, composed your own music, curated politically and socially sensitive art and theatre, hosted Science Debates, Model United Nations Conferences and TED X Events, and produced podcasts, newspapers and entered films into international competitions. That range of accomplishments at such a young age is truly amazing!\n\nReading about the dozens of service projects UNIS conducts every year, and the contributions of the class of 2019 to them, I was also struck by their wide variety, from collecting funds for children with congenital heart disease, to teaching music, swimming, language and sports, to visiting and working with disabled orphans, and providing microcredit loans to low-income families, especially women, in order that they can undertake entrepreneurial projects.\n\nYou are already demonstrating many strong UN values and I, for one, am impressed. The values that UNIS represents, and has very clearly inculcated in each of you, are more important than ever before in today’s world. While being in UNIS has been a privilege, for which you should thank your parents most of all, it also carries special responsibilities.\n\nLet me not sugarcoat it: This is a complicated and increasingly complex and challenging world we live in today. Extremist ideologies are destabilizing many parts of the world and threatening not just the values and principles of the United Nations but multilateralism, global peace and security, and decades of human progress made since the UN was founded. We face serious, urgent problems, and your generation has unfortunately inherited many of them. The challenges of battling extremism, climate change, celebrating and advancing multiculturalism, and protecting and ensuring the universal application of human rights, are but only a few of the critical challenges that your generation inherits, and will need to better address than ours has done. But looking at you, I believe there is enough hope and heart - mixed with intelligence and skill - to do anything. To solve any problem you want. To create anything you want to see. To build and improve communities and to be kinder to each other, in big and small ways.\n\nDon’t miss this opportunity – and please seize it with both hands! Young people like you are the future of the world. It is more important than ever to speak up and speak out about the world you dream of, and most importantly, the world you know you deserve. As young adults – you are part of the complicated political, social and cultural tapestry of humanity that is tasked with the duty of charting a course for this planet. As we look into the future we can see that poverty eradication is now a possibility that is achievable by 2030 if there is the political will to make it happen. In that case, yours will be the first generation in world history to experience a world largely free from hunger and poverty. Many other important challenges such as climate change will remain as defining issues of our times, and new ones are emerging all the time.\n\nI would like to encourage you, as you embark on this next exciting phase of your lives, to embrace and address these challenges in the spirit of the United Nations Charter which represents the UN’s best ideals. Class of 2019 - my hope for you is that you can find purpose in your work, your relationships and your adventures in life. But I also hope you can find meaning in how you engage with the world beyond yourselves.\n\nMy best wishes for the future to each one of you, and don’t forget to savour every moment of the exciting world that you are going into!\n\nThank you and good luck!"}]}

The event is a public affirmation of the United Nations' commitment to empower young people, especially in a country like Viet Nam where a third of the population are youth and adolescents below the age of 29. This reflects a wider global situation, as the current generation of youth is the largest in history.\n\nBut considering the needs and aspirations of youth in matters of socio-economic development, climate change, peace and security, is much more than a demographic imperative. Too often overlooked, youth play a positive, inspirational and active role in promoting socio-economic growth, peace, and sustainable development. Inter-connected globally like never before, young people want to and already contribute to the resilience of their communities, proposing innovative solutions, driving social progress and inspiring change. Young people's empowerment, development and engagement is an end in itself, as well as a means to build a better world. The UN recognizes it cannot achieve its mission without partnering with young people and ensuring they are not only heard but understood, not only engaged but empowered, and not only supporting but leading global efforts and processes.\n\nThis year, we celebrate the Day with the theme of \"Safe and Friendly Spaces for Youth\" across the globe. What do we mean by this? Safe and youth-friendly spaces can refer to physical and virtual places, environments, platforms and mechanisms where young people can gather, exchange, express opinions, engage in activities related to diverse needs and rights and have their voices and concerns taken into account and addressed properly. They can range from decision-making forums to recreation avenues for arts, culture, and sports; from digital spaces world where young people access information and interact with each other to community-based physical places.\n\nHere, the important issue to stress is access, and access for all, including vulnerable and marginalized youth who have been affected by social, economic and physical hardship. These groups of young people, in particular, are often most vulnerable to socio-economic development, as well as having difficulty in accessing information, knowledge to demand solutions for challenges. They experience intersecting forms of marginalization, the struggle with the brunt of global barriers to realisation of basic rights and issues such as gender-based violence, social exclusion, climate change and migration, etc. Working together, we need to ensure that no one is left behind.\n\nI would like to congratulate the Government of Viet Nam on its considerable efforts in improving the participation of adolescents and youth in the development of youth-related policies and frameworks in the past years, especially amidst all the different challenges as a middle-income country at a time of rapid social and economic change. The United Nations will continue to support these efforts, and to work with youth with the aim of increasing the participation of young people in developing, implementing and monitoring the policies that affect their lives as well as to nurture safe and friendly spaces for all youth as part of their basic rights. Youth need to be able to speak up and speak out, to lead their lives and build the world they want to live in – and as well to speak out for those who are not here today and who are less fortunate in having access to places where their voices are heard.\n\nDear friends, the UN Secretary General put it very well when he said recently that \"The hopes of the world rest on young people. Peace, economic dynamism, social justice, tolerance — all this and more, today and tomorrow, depends on tapping into the power of youth \"\n\nWell, today is your day. Enjoy it and have a great celebration!\n\nXin cám ơn !"}]}

He would very much have liked to be here today but regrets that he is unable to participate in this important event. He has, however, provided his opening remarks given the national importance of the event, and has asked me to deliver these remarks on his behalf in my role as Chair of the UN in Vietnam’s Governance and Justice Results Group.\n\nIn early 2019, Viet Nam completed its Third Cycle Universal Periodic Review (or UPR). Since then, the Government has prepared a National Master Plan to implement the recommendations received by Vietnam. This workshop aims to introduce Viet Nam’s National Master Plan with all stakeholders who are and will play a key role in UPR implementation. Let me start by expressing my appreciation to MOFA for hosting this event. I would also like to extend my gratitude to UNDP for their extensive support in making this event happen.\n\nThe UN considers the UPR process to be an invaluable opportunity for the Government of Viet Nam to engage directly with all relevant stakeholders and receive guidance from other UN Members States. It is also an important occasion to reflect on Government policy and practice, and develop new measures, all with the objective of strengthening human rights protection in Viet Nam.\n\nOver recent years, Viet Nam has made progress in human rights promotion and protection through the ratification of major international human rights treaties. This includes ratification of theConvention against Tortureand theConvention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. Viet Nam has also made efforts to improve the domestic legal framework by revising the Criminal Code and the Criminal Procedure Code in 2015 to explicitly include some provisions that are more in line with international human rights law. These developments were recognized and welcomed by other States during the UPR.\n\nDuring the 32nd session of the UPR Working Group held in January 2019, Viet Nam presented the National Report for the 3rd cycle and participated in a constructive dialogue withone hundred and twenty-two(122) UN Member States.Two hundred and ninety-one(291) recommendations were made, of which Viet Nam acceptedtwo hundred and forty-one(241).\n\nWhile the interactive dialogue between  Member States in Geneva is always an important event, it is more crucial that this dialogue leads to the recommendations made being implemented. Looking back at Viet Nam’s 2nd UPR cycle, the 2015 National Master Plan played a key role in the implementation of the accepted recommendations. The National Master Plan for the 3rd UPR cycle was adopted in December 2019 with a similar objective – to set a path for the implementation of the accepted recommendations nationwide. For this Plan to succeed, each stakeholder must be aware of and fully understand the responsibilities vested in them. Today’s workshop provides that opportunity. All stakeholders will have the chance to discuss the Plan’s components and devise appropriate measures to address the priority areas identified in the Plan.\n\nOne priority area of the Master Plan, and also a central topic of today’s event, is human rights education and awareness-raising. Encouraging all individuals to understand and uphold their own rights, as well as those of others, is of fundamental importance because it contributes to the effective realization of all human rights. Given that at least 15 % of the accepted recommendations refer explicitly to human rights education and awareness-raising, special efforts need to be made to deliver results in this area. In addition to the Government, there are various actors within society, such as communities, civil society and the private sector, who have an important role to play in promoting and providing human rights education.\n\nIn the context of today’s workshop and this important process over the coming years, the UN in Vietnam would like to emphasise three key messages today.\n\nFirst,human rights are fundamental to and inextricably linked to sustainable development. Implementing human rights commitments will also contribute to the realisation of the SDGs.\n\nSecond,all stakeholders play a vital role in the implementation of UPR recommendations in Viet Nam. International experience shows that public participation, including through a vibrant community of civic organizations, provides governments with crucial partners in giving voice to vulnerable groups, identifying risks or challenges, and finding solutions best suited to affected communities. We must all look to support this engagement and ensure that the full potential of Government engagement with the public is realized.\n\nAnd last but not least,the international human rights framework including the UPR is intended to protect the most vulnerable, ensuring that no one is left behind. By supporting Viet Nam throughout the 3rd UPR cycle, the UN will continue to invest in strengthening our focus on “leaving no one behind.”\n\nIn conclusion, allow me to reiterate the UN Country Team’s commitment, as a longstanding partner of the people and Government of Viet Nam, to support the efforts of the Government in implementing the UPR Master Plan and, in so doing, to advancing the 2030 Agenda. We stand with the people of Vietnam in supporting the country’s continued engagement with this invaluable universal global mechanism to help protect, promote and fulfil the rights of everyone in Viet Nam.\n\nThank you (XinCảmƠn)!"}]}

The GCF has quickly and surely become one of the most important financing mechanisms to assist developing countries in adaptation and mitigation practices to counter the effects of climate change. In the same vein, I would like to commend the Board of the Green Climate Fund for making swift decisions and approving a number of strategic projects that focus on transformative action to achieve Agenda 2030 and the Sustainable Development Goals.\n\nGlobal climate change challenges can only be met if we can strengthen our collaboration and joint action for both adaptation and mitigation measures. This will require a significant increase of financial and technical contributions from all partners, including the private sector, academia and civil society organizations. Sustainable development is one of the GCF's six key investment criteria, together with impact, paradigm shift, needs of the recipient, country ownership, efficiency and effectiveness. Bringing these criteria together will create an effective framework for climate action, but it will need ownership by all involved partners and should be backed up by effective management and strong monitoring systems.\n\nPlease allow me to congratulate the Vietnamese Government on the approval of two GCF projects focusing on \"improving the resilience of vulnerable coastal communities to climate change related impacts in Viet Nam\" and \"scaling-up energy efficiency for industrial enterprises in Viet Nam\". These projects aim to address two of the most important adaptation and mitigation concerns in this country.\n\nThe first project, approved in 2016 as one of the first projects in Asia, has been developed and is being implemented in close cooperation between the Government and UNDP in Viet Nam, aiming to strengthen storm and flood protection for coastal communities. The project will therefore support resilient housing, planting and rehabilitation of mangrove forests, and systematized climate risk assessments for the public and private sectors. The project has seen joint effective management, and has set up strong monitoring systems, ensuring that benefits are achieved for all target groups.\n\nI wish to use this example and opportunity to highlight the effort that UN agencies – both as accredited entities and readiness delivery partners – including the FAO, UNDP and UN Environment as well as the Multilateral Development Banks, make to ensure that important and critical assistance is delivered to countries that need it most, and in the quickest possible time. The challenge of climate change requires effective partnerships and long-term commitment, and the success of the GCF and UN agencies in assisting countries to tackle climate change and achieve the SDGs is fundamentally intertwined. It is clear that climate change action needs to be viewed as integral to the achievement of Agenda 2030 and the Sustainable Development Goals.\n\nThe UN in Viet Nam as well as in Asia will continue to support Governments to prepare their National Country Framework for the GCF through an inclusive and transparent process, ensuring that the prioritization of investments is decided upon jointly by all stakeholders, including those communities coping directly with the impacts of climate change. Furthermore, we stand ready to provide the technical and operational support needed by governments, the private sector and civil society partners to raise awareness around the Green Climate Fund and identify strategic opportunities for Asian countries.\n\nLadies and gentlemen,\n\nAllow me to conclude by saying that I trust that through the fruitful discussions which I am sure will take place at this dialogue forum you will strengthen and refine the specific and collective actions needed for low-carbon and climate resilient development.\n\nWe look forward to strengthened collaboration between Viet Nam, the UN and the Green Climate Fund in the coming months and years. And, we will continue to support the GCF's effective monitoring of climate action by helping to institutionalize policies and best practices on key issues such as ensuring the participation of ethnic minorities, the full integration of environmental and social management, as well as gender equality and social inclusion concerns.\n\nThank you!

This is the seventh year in a row that we are sharing the results from this unique nationwide survey.\n\nAt the UN, we believe that people should be at the centre of development, and this requires that we listen to the voices of citizens on issues that affect their lives. To a large degree, good governance entails people having more of a say in all of the decisions that shape their lives and so PAPI needs to be viewed as an instrument seeking to promote good governance in Viet Nam.\n\nTo support this goal, PAPI reflects the actual experiences of citizens in all 63 provinces of Viet Nam highlighting the performance of the government in public administration, public service delivery, and related governance responsibilities.\n\nAt a practical level, PAPI, given its nation-wide coverage, supports efforts to improve provincial governance and public administration performance by creating constructive competition and promoting learning among local authorities, and by enabling citizens to benchmark their local government’s performance and advocate for improvement.\n\nA great amount of work is required to carry out the survey, analyze the data and create the annual PAPI report. In 2017 over 14,000 randomly selected citizens from all 63 provinces were interviewed. To date, over 103,000 citizens from across Viet Nam have shared their experiences and assessments since the first pilot survey in 2009.\n\nPAPI looks at citizens’ experiences of local government performance through six dimensions:\n\nGood governance in all of these dimensions will contribute to Viet Nam’s achievement of its national Agenda for Sustainable Development and the global Agenda 2030, especially Goal 16 of the Sustainable Development Goals, which emphasizes citizen participation and inclusion in governance, as well as the need for strong institutions which promote accountability, responsiveness, and anti-corruption.\n\nWe are encouraged that to date 51 of the country’s 63 provinces have issued action plans, directives, official letters or resolutions to request that local government agencies respond to the citizen feedback generated by PAPI.\n\nAt the national level, the index continues to provide useful information for state, government and National Assembly agencies - including in the health care, education, environmental management, and government inspection areas - to support both their policy-making and oversight work.\n\nLadies and Gentlemen,\n\nNow, allow me to turn to the 2017 PAPI report. So, what does it tell us?\n\nAs will soon be elaborated by my colleagues and its authors, the 2017 survey results are mixed and reveal both encouraging and worrying trends. Overall, citizens reported improvement, although at different rates, in five of the six dimensions of governance and public administration that make up the index.\n\nParticularly noteworthy is the reversal in the downward trend since 2013 in control of corruption in the public sector. Citizens report improvements in both their perceptions and their personal experiences in this area. This may reflect the central government’s unprecedented crackdown on mismanagement and corruption, which signals a new level of seriousness and commitment by the government to fighting these problems. We hope these efforts will seek to address root causes and be both systemic and comprehensive at all levels. It is still too early to tell, however, whether this will be the case. What is clear, however, is that despite the improvement in the PAPI scores for control of corruption in the public sector, they are still below the levels found in 2012. This means that although the direction of change is positive, much work still remains to be done to fight corruption – and to ensure that the findings of the 2017 PAPI report do not represent just a temporary aberration but signal the start of a systemic and fundamental reversal of what has been a worrying longer-term trend.\n\nOther positive results in 2017 are reduced gender inequality in land titling, and a continued increase in the proportion of citizens with health insurance, with the strongest gains in the latter occurring in rural areas.\n\nHowever, there are also some causes for concern. While the number of respondents reporting land seizures in their localities has continued to decline, citizens were less satisfied in 2017 with compensation for land taken from them. Another worrying finding is that women and ethnic minorities gave lower scores than the ethnic majority Kinh and males in five out of six dimensions, with the exception of public service delivery.\n\nIn terms of provincial performance, most improved their overall scores in governance and public service delivery compared to 2016. Interestingly, there is a consistent pattern: Northern provinces tend to perform better in the participation areas, while provinces in the Mekong Delta and the Southeast score higher in dimensions related to public services. These findings reflect the different governance challenges faced by different regions of the country.\n\nAn overall somewhat surprising result is how high concerns about poverty still feature – these appear to reflect both individual concerns about slipping back into poverty which still remain across all provinces and surprisingly all income groups and a general concern that unless Viet Nam defeats poverty once and for all it will not be able to become a developed country.\n\nOverall, there is a sobering reality. Even the best performing provinces fall far short of what is desirable: there is a significant gap between the highest provincial score – around 40 points – and the maximum possible score of 60 in all six dimensions. There was also a large gap between the highest and the lowest provincial scores in 2017, revealing major differences in how provinces are performing.\n\nLadies and gentlemen,\n\nThe progress and challenges evident in this year’s PAPI Report reflect the need for a continued focus on transparency and public consultation with citizens.\n\nOne opportunity for Viet Nam to improve governance in all dimensions would be by joining the Open Government Partnership, an international initiative of more than 90 countries. Participating governments make a declaration to promote transparency, empower citizens, fight corruption, and harness new technologies to strengthen governance.\n\nAt the local level, provincial governments should carefully review the detailed data in this year’s report – including new maps and charts – in order to better understand where and why their citizens are less satisfied, and then work out action plans to address these shortcomings, paying special attention to the “missing middle” population which is vulnerable to slipping back into poverty. The action plans need to be translated into concrete actions with clear timelines so that citizens can feel and experience local governments’ actual responses to their expectations.\n\nI also wish to highlight that the 2017 PAPI results point to the need for continued emphasis on inclusive and equitable development. Viet Nam should continue to provide inclusive health and education services and expand social protection based on life-cycle and rights-based principles, while accelerating poverty reduction amongst its poorest population groups.\n\nI recognize that, like elsewhere, central and local governments will continue to face challenges in meeting rising expectations from citizens, who will be increasingly better informed and educated. Like the government, we at UNDP also feel the pressure to ensure that PAPI meets increasing expectations from both local governments and citizens and that it is viewed as a helpful tool to help improve governance and public administration performance, and inform policy choices in Viet Nam.\n\nLadies and gentlemen;\n\nAs implied by the cover design of this year’s report, PAPI, at one level, is about connecting the dots. In other words, understanding and strengthening the connections between central and local government agencies, as well as between policy and practice, between action plans and actions, and between promises and the delivery on those promises is what PAPI is about at one level.\n\nIn order to ensure that PAPI is a driver of change, UNDP will continue to support the Government as well as all Vietnamese citizens, at national and provincial level, on ways to utilize the wealth of information in the report in order to benefit the Vietnamese people.\n\nWe continue to join hands with Vietnam in its efforts to enhance good governance and public administration for all citizens, and to achieve the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\n\nFinally, on behalf of the implementing partners (the Centre for Community Support and Development Studies and the Centre for Research and Training of the Viet Nam Fatherland Front in particular), I would like to thank the Swiss Agency for Cooperation and Development for their generous support from 2011 to 2017. I am also very pleased that the Embassy of Ireland is providing support for the 2018 PAPI, and the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has made a commitment to support PAPI efforts from 2018 through 2021.\n\nAgain, thank you all for your participation and for your attention this morning.\n\nXin Cảm Ơn!\n\nFor press release on 2017 PAPI Report Launch event, please clidkhere."}]}

They promote inclusion, equality, and growth.\n\nThey underwrite freedom. They ensure lasting stability.\n\nYour election is a reminder of the obligations of every Member State:\n\nTo uphold human rights in all its dimensions – from social, economic, and cultural, to political and civil rights.\n\nTo eradicate poverty. To promote universal health care. To guarantee education for all.\n\nTo ensure respect for fundamental freedoms – including of expression and association.\n\nTo protect civil society working to bring these rights to life – and to ensure their full engagement – from journalists and human rights defenders to environmental advocates.\n\nWe look forward to deepening our work with you for peace, sustainable development, and human rights for all.\n\nExcellencies,\n\nOur world is facing great peril.\n\nDeveloping economies, in particular, have been battered by the COVID-19 pandemic and are facing an avalanche of other crises – from the fallout of the war in Ukraine to soaring food and energy prices, spiralling inflation, crushing debt burdens, and shrinking fiscal space.\n\nThey are the victims of the inequalities and injustices in the global economic and financial system that requires urgent reform.\n\nWe need justice, greater solidarity and greater cooperation.\n\nAnd nowhere do we need it more – and more urgently – than in our fight against the climate crisis.\n\nWe are already witnessing horrific climate impacts at just 1.2 degrees of warming.\n\nViet Nam – with over 3000km of coastline and many low-lying cities and delta regions – is on the frontlines against climate catastrophe.\n\nNearly a quarter of your citizens live in the Mekong Delta.\n\nIt is your agricultural and industrial heartland.\n\nAnd it is one of the most vulnerable places in the world – exposed to rising sea levels, saltwater intrusion, flooding and changing rainfall intensity.\n\nWithout much more concerted global climate action, over one million Vietnamese could be pushed into poverty in this decade alone.\n\nAnd the already staggering economic costs of climate damage in Viet Nam could rise fifty-fold by 2050.\n\nExcellencies,\n\nThe G20 economies together account for 80 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions and 80 per cent of global GDP.\n\nThey must lead.\n\nThey must reduce their emissions this decade -- in line with keeping global warming to 1.5 degrees -- and fully pivot to renewable energy.\n\nWealthier countries must keep their promise to provide $100 billion to support developing countries to build resilience.\n\nAt least half of all international climate finance must go to adaptation, in support of populations affected already by climate change.\n\nAnd we must urgently address the impacts of climate change that are beyond countries’ abilities to adapt.\n\nAction on loss and damage is a moral imperative that must be front and centre at the upcoming UN Climate Conference – COP27 – in Egypt.\n\nAll this is essential to rebuild trust between developed countries and the global south.\n\nBut every country has a role to play.\n\nBecause even if all developed countries were to reach net-zero by 2030, we would still not be able to keep to 1.5 degrees of global warming without further action by the rest of the world.\n\nThis means we cannot wait until after 2030 to move away from fossil fuels – particularly coal – or to peak global emissions.\n\nIf the world does not cut emissions by 45 per cent by 2030, then achieving net-zero by 2050 will be a pipe dream.\n\nThat will mean a climate nightmare for billions of people.\n\nWe need all hands on deck now to realize an energy transition that is global, sustainable, just, inclusive and equitable.\n\nViet Nam is stepping up with your bold decision to accelerate your phaseout of coal, jumpstart the renewables revolution, and achieve net-zero by 2050.\n\nBut to do so, Viet Nam needs the support to speed this transition and accelerate the greening of your economy, and that support is needed now.\n\nLast year in Glasgow, I put forward a proposal for stepped up and targeted solidarity to help make it happen.\n\nSpecifically, to build coalitions of support to help key emerging economies unlock major emissions cuts needed now – coalitions that should include developed countries, financial institutions, and those with the technical know-how.\n\nWe call these coalitions the Just Energy Transition Partnerships.\n\nAnd Viet Nam is leading the way.\n\nYou are pioneering a new framework of collaboration to deliver a fair, inclusive energy transition towards renewables.\n\nThrough these Partnerships, you are creating a crucial new tool to unlock emissions cuts our world needs in the 2020s.\n\nAnd you are blazing a path for the entire region to transform from an epicentre of coal emissions to a global green economic powerhouse.\n\nYour leadership through the Just Energy Transition Partnerships has already set in motion unprecedented levels of coordination both within the Vietnamese government and with partners.\n\nBy embracing the Just Energy Transition Partnership, you are helping to set a new development example to the world.\n\nYou are its owner, its shaper, and its driving force.\n\nAnd success will require international solidarity.  Developed countries must fully engage in these partnerships.\n\nBut success will also require a whole-of-society approach – with youth, civil society, and the private sector working side-by-side with government and the National Assembly in open and honest dialogue.\n\nAnd you can count on my personal engagement to push your partners to deliver the investments, the technical support, and the finance that is needed at speed, at scale, and at concessional levels.\n\nThe United Nations is ready to ask the international community to fully engage to support the courageous decision by Viet Nam to reach carbon neutrality in 2050.\n\nNow Excellencies,\n\nViet Nam has come a long way. And the journey continues.\n\nYou once again have the opportunity to be a powerhouse for change.\n\nTo secure a climate resilient future.\n\nTo leave no one behind.\n\nTo transform your economy and help transform the world.\n\nThe United Nations is proud to be your partner – every step of the way.\n\nTiến lên, cùng tiến lên.[Onward, we advance together– as we just heard in the Vietnamese national anthem].\n\nThank you.

I also wish to thank the local authorities, especially from Tam Ky and Ben Tre, for their strong engagement and ownership of the project.\n\nThe rapid urbanisation of Viet Nam has brought with it enormous opportunities for economic growth, innovation, and poverty reduction. But it has also introduced complex and interlinked challenges: environmental degradation, spatial inequality, overstretched infrastructure, and new forms of vulnerability – particularly in the face of climate change and public health risks.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, the ISCB project has made a meaningful contribution toward Viet Nam’s sustainable and inclusive urban development. It has helped strengthen institutions, pilot practical tools, and advance knowledge-based, people-centred planning. It has done so not through grand declarations, but through the steady, often quiet work of building capacity, testing approaches, connecting institutions, and listening to communities. We are pleased to have supported this process alongside the Ministry of Construction and our development partners.\n\nDistinguished participants,\n\nToday’s event is not a closure – but a transition point. From experimentation to institutionalisation. From vision to systems change. And from working in silos to working in synergy. It offers a moment to reflect on what we have learned, and to look ahead – together – to what is still possible.\n\nLet me share three reflections from the United Nations in this regard:\n\nFirst, the ISCB project demonstrates the power of multi-level and multi-sectoral collaboration. The achievements we see today – from improved planning tools to more inclusive urban practices – were made possible because national ministries, local governments, technical institutes, communities, and international partners all came together around a common purpose. This is the spirit of the whole-of-government and whole-of-society approach that Viet Nam is promoting. It is also at the heart of UN reforms – calling for integration, innovation, and collaboration to deliver better results for people and planet.\n\nSecond, the project’s outputs – such as the policy briefs, training materials, planning handbook, and participatory tools – form a practical knowledge package that can support national and sub-national stakeholders as they navigate the next phase of urban reform. These tools respond directly to Viet Nam’s current priorities: strengthening institutional capacity, modernising legal frameworks, promoting public-private-community partnerships, and fostering green and resilient urban spaces.\n\nThird, the project offers a concrete model of how international cooperation can be strategic, responsive, and nationally owned. The work in Tam Ky and Ben Tre – with their diverse local conditions – shows how integrated planning and community engagement can deliver more inclusive, locally anchored outcomes. These experiences are timely as Viet Nam is embarking on important structural reforms – including urban legal harmonisation, district and provincial restructuring, and the development of national urban strategies aligned with Resolution 06 and Resolution 66.\n\nExcellencies, colleagues,\n\nAs Viet Nam looks toward the future, the urban agenda will become even more central. By 2040, two-thirds of the population will live in cities. And these cities will need to deliver on many fronts: climate resilience, housing, mobility, productivity, and digital inclusion – all while leaving no one behind. UN-Habitat’s Strategic Plan 2026–2029 calls for exactly this kind of transformation:\n\n• Cities that are inclusive and people-centred,\n\n• Systems that are adaptive and interoperable, and\n\n• Governance that is responsive and participatory.\n\nSustainable urban development requires long-term commitment. It calls for patience, for experimentation, and partnerships deepen in mutual respect and shared responsibility. The progress we see today is not the result of a single effort – but the outcome of many institutions, over many years, working towards a common goal. Cities are where innovation happens, where climate action must take root, where the SDGs will be won or lost. That is why the United Nations will continue to support Viet Nam in building inclusive, climate-resilient, and forward-looking cities.\n\nThrough the UN Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework, we will work to bring together policy advice, data innovation, financing options, and capacity support – with and for the people of Viet Nam. And through partnerships like this one – with Switzerland, with the Government of Viet Nam, and with local communities – we aim to turn commitments into action.\n\nLet us carry forward the momentum of this project to inspire bolder, broader, and more inclusive collaboration. Let us continue to build cities that leave no one behind, that unlock human potential, and that serve as engines for sustainable development.\n\nThe United Nations is proud to be your partner on this journey.\n\nThank you. Xin cảm ơn."}]}

At the annual dialogue, both sides expressed deep appreciation for the partnership between the Government of Viet Nam and the United Nations over the past 47 years. His Excellency Prime Minister also shared the priorities, advantages, as well as challenges -- so that we could address them and together identify creative and strategic solutions to accelerate the implementation of the SDGs -- and ultimately achieve Viet Nam’s ambitious development priorities.\n\nFrom a poor and isolated country, devastated by decades of prolonged war, Viet Nam has gone through a remarkable journey to become a lower-middle-income country assuming a high profile at regional and global stages, including as a member of the Human Rights Council. Viet Nam equally importantly is actively participating in the noble mission of peacebuilding led by the United Nations.\n\nFrom 2022 to present, the Ministry of Public Security has sent 4 Working Groups with 12 police officers to join UN peacekeeping operations at UNMISS (UN Mission in South Sudan) and UNISFA (UN Interim Security Force for Abyei) and 1 police officer to work at the UN HQ Police Department on an individual basis.\n\nIt is important to note that among the above-mentioned police officers, there were 4 women police officers -- 32.5%, higher than the goal of women’s participation in Peacebuilding set by the UN. When participating in UN peacekeeping missions, police officers from Viet Nam have demonstrated their qualities, capacities, professional qualifications, and quickly adapted to the complex conditions and challenging operating environment of the UN missions. In addition, they have spread the beautiful image of the country and people of Viet Nam as friendly, hospitable, and peace-loving to the UN and international friends.\n\nAlong with the deployment of individual police officers, Viet Nam’s Ministry of Public Security pledged theFormed Police Unit (FPU)in support of UN peacekeeping operations and set the goal to update it to the UN Level 3 readiness level from current Level 2.\n\nThis UN Certified Instructor Development courseaims to enhance a pool of United Nations-certified instructors, who can further deliver similar courses for the benefit of future police peacekeepers in the national training centres across the region.\n\nI am very pleased to learn that in addition to those from the host country – Viet Nam, there are 9 participants from Cambodia, Indonesia, Nepal and Sri-Lanka have joined the training.\n\nI would like to express our sincere thanks and appreciation tothe Government of Viet Nam, the Ministry of Public Security, the Viet Nam People’s Security Academyfor hosting this course, tothe United States Department of State and its Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairsfor supporting this event.\n\nLast but not least, big congratulations to theCourse Director, Deputy Course Director, the entire facilitating team and all participants for successfully concluding this iteration of the UN Job-Specific Certified Instructor Development course.\n\nAt a time of grave challenges in the history of mankind, the UN system needs enhanced support from all Member States, especially from emerging powers such as Viet Nam. In this regard, we very highly appreciate Viet Nam’s increasing contributions to the UN, particularly UN peace operations. We commit our continued support to the Government of Viet Nam, and the Ministry of Public Security in this noble journey.\n\nI wish you all good health and success.\n\nXin Cam On!"}]}

Allow me to share a few reflections as we prepare for the year ahead.\n\nI have only been in Viet Nam for less than two years but I recognize the fast pace of the country’s growth.This country has transformed itself as one of the fastest-growing digital economies in Southeast Asia, attracting foreign direct investment and expanding export markets. Viet Nam's strategic location, young workforce, and commitment to economic reforms have made it an attractive destination for businesses.\n\nFor the UN, we also highly value Viet Nam’s commitment to global cooperation and multilateralism, shaping regional agendas and fostering cooperation among nations. At the same time, Viet Nam has also actively pursued trade liberalization and have signed various free trade agreements, opening new markets, enhancing access for Vietnamese goods and services, and stimulating economic growth.\n\nConsequently, Viet Nam has made great strides in improving the living standards and lifting millions of people out of poverty, with a vision to become a high-income country by 2045 and realize net-zero emissions by 2050.  This vision drives Viet Nam’s commitment to achieve the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\n\nThe UN works closely with the Government and partners on the six policy priorities and recommendations to advance the SDGs: supporting science, technology and innovation; developing quality human resources; managing resources effectively; adapting and mitigating climate change through green and circular economy; and ensuring that people are at the center of every decision, policy, and action.\n\nIt is for this reason that I join you this evening – to encourage active engagement of the private sector in accelerating Viet Nam’s SDG priorities. Three quick ideas:\n\nFirst, align operations, strategies, and practices with the SDGs. Actions include reducing carbon emissions, promoting responsible production and consumption, ensuring fair labor practices including equal pay for equal work, and protecting natural resources. In sum, integrating sustainable practices into core business models, supply and value chains.\n\nSecond, invest in ventures that have positive social and environmental impact. Business can and should drive sustainable development.\n\nThird, promote innovation and collaboration for sustainability -- invest in research and development to create new technologies, products, and services that address societal challenges related to the SDGs.\n\nBy embracing sustainable business practices, the private sector can accelerate SDG implementation while creating value for shareholders and society, as well as protecting the planet.\n\nLet us join hands for a more inclusive and sustainable future.\n\nThank you! Xin cam on!"}]}

Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh and Vietnamese & International Female Diplomats\nDate: \n\nXin chào and a good evening.\n\nSince 2022, on the 24th of June, we commemorate the International Day of Women in Diplomacy. The establishment of this International Day by the UN General Assembly serves as a reminder of the achievements and the challenges in ensuring gender parity in diplomatic roles worldwide.\n\nHistorically, the representation of women in diplomacy has been minimal. Only four of the 850 delegates who signed the UN Charter in 1945 were women. Since then, women’s representation in bilateral diplomacy and at the United Nations has increased. But progress has been slow. International decision-making spaces often lack women’s presence and structural barriers remain.\n\nOne of the United Nations’ greatest achievements was the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948, spearheaded by a woman – Ms Eleanor Roosevelt. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights recognized the equal rights of men and women as fundamental human rights.\n\nWomen’s engagement in peace processes in Liberia and Ireland are just two examples of women’s fundamental roles in achieving durable success.\n\nDespite this, diplomacy remains male-dominated, with women serving as Heads of State and Government in only 28 countries. At the ministerial level, women hold just some 25% of foreign affairs portfolios.\n\nViet Nam’s pioneering legacy in women in diplomacy is embodied byMadam Nguyen Thi Binh, the first Minister of Foreign Affairs of Viet Nam and who served in this capacity from 1969 to 1976. In 1973, Madam Binh signed the Paris Peace Accords to end the war and restore peace in Viet Nam.\n\nAlthough there has been no woman Foreign Minister appointed since then, Viet Nam has had three female Deputy Ministers of Foreign Affairs. Ms. Nguyen Minh Hang (appointed in October 2023), Ms. Le Thi Thu Hang (December 2022) and Ms. Nguyen Phuong Nga (2011).\n\nOver the past eight decades, women in Viet Nam have significantly contributed in various positions and sectors to the nation’s rise as a beacon of peace and progress[1].\n\nWhile each country context may be different, balanced political participation and power-sharing between women and men in decision-making is the internationally agreed target set in the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, as well as SDG 5. While no country has achieved gender equality, being intentional about achieving parity and promoting women’s leadership has worked well. Setting quotas makes a difference. In countries with legislated quotas, women’s representation is 5% and 7% higher in parliaments and local government, respectively, compared to countries without.\n\nIn just over a decade, Viet Nam has improved its global ranking on gender equality. Such progress has been achieved through bold actions such as adopting laws, directives, national target programmes and leadership drive for gender equality.\n\nThe UN itself has struggled with gender parity. However, significant progress has been made under the leadership of the Secretary-General Antonio Guterres. In 2020, gender parity was achieved among senior leaders of the UN. Nevertheless, we are yet to see a female Secretary General of the United Nations and women are still underrepresented in UN missions and peacekeeping operations where diversity is crucial.\n\nViet Nam is one of the few nations exceeding UN benchmarks for female participation in peacekeeping: about 16% of individually deployed peacekeepers from Viet Nam are military women and more than 30% of policewomen, higher than the UN average[2]. These efforts underscore Viet Nam’s commitment to UN Security Council Resolution 1325 on Women, Peace, and Security.\n\nAlso on the global stage, Viet Nam has promoted the gender parity agenda in its role as a Human Rights Council member. Viet Nam is now a member of UN Women’s Executive Board. Recently in New York, the Vice Chairwoman of the National Assembly, Madam Nguyen Thi Thanh, actively contributed to the 69th Commission on the Status of Women, highlighting the importance of women’s equal participation across all sectors, including STEM.\n\nThese contributions highlight not only the vital role of women in diplomacy, but also the critical importance of advancing gender equality and women’s rights through multilateral engagement — a cause to which Viet Nam has consistently demonstrated strong commitment.\n\nStrong commitment abroad must be rooted in strong commitment at home, to advance women’s leadership, especially, in governance.\n\nIn this regard too, Viet Nam has shown great commitment. Currently, more than 30% of Viet Nam’s National Assembly is comprised of women; a percentage higher than most regional peers.\n\nHowever, as Viet Nam undergoes one of its most historic administrative reforms, it is essential to ensure that women have an equal opportunity to participate in the restructured government system.\n\nWith a more streamlined civil service, the dissolution of district-level organs, and the merger of several provinces, Viet Nam must remain vigilant to ensure that the progress made in women’s participation in governance is not rolled back.\n\nThis will be particularly important in the upcoming general election, scheduled for 15 March 2026 — a timely opportunity for Viet Nam to reaffirm its commitment to ensuring women’s equal participation at all levels of decision-making.\n\nWe hope to see more women elected to representative bodies and appointed to key leadership positions across the newly established 34 provinces. Such leadership at home can be reflected in Viet Nam’s growing diplomatic leadership on the global stage.\n\nWomen’s equal participation at all decision-making levels is key to unlock the transformational changes needed for a sustainable future.\n\nWhen full representation is achieved, we will be closer to an inclusive, just, and prosperous society reflecting our shared Sustainable Development Goals.

The COVID-19 pandemic is generating suffering and damage in every region. It poses a far-reaching threat to human rights. As Secretary-General Guterres has warned, itthreatens not only development, but also \"enhanced instability, enhanced unrest, and enhanced conflict.\"\n\nWe do not know how the virus itself might evolve, or whether those affected will permanently be immune. We do not have complete data of who is being infected and developing the most severe symptoms -– or whether there are links to contributory factors, such as pollution. We do know that vital measures must be taken to upgrade health and social systems to ensure the greatest possible support to those most impacted by the epidemic. We know we cannot afford to leave anyone behind in this effort.\n\nAnd we know that lockdowns cannot continue forever. Exit strategies must be carefully devised to ensure our societies and people recover.\n\nToday, we have come together for this informal meeting of the Council, although we may be physically apart. I hope this contributes to the creation ofa more cooperative, global and human rights-based approach to the crisis.\n\nAll States are facing tremendous challenges. Many are demonstrating their commitment to protecting human rights through this epidemic. Others should be encouraged to do so, in order to make their efforts to tackle COVID more effective for everyone – both in their nations, and across the world.\n\nIt is natural – and necessary – for national efforts to be a strong priority in any crisis. But this is a global pandemic, and only global solidarity will ensure that we can combat it effectively. This crisis makes clear how much we need collective international action and demonstrates the value of our multilateral organizations. The United Nations was created to prevent, mitigate and more effectively address international crises. I urge all of us to work together to promote a strong, multilateral, cooperative and global approach.\n\nFirst I want to address some urgent issues regarding economic and social rights\n\nThe pandemic is exposing the damaging impact ofinequalities,in every society.\n\nIn developed countries, fault-lines in access to health care; in labor rights and social protections; in living-space; and in dignity are suddenly very visible.\n\nIn developing countries, where a large portion of the population may rely on daily income to survive, the impact could be far greater. The millions of people who have little access to health-care, and who, by necessity, live in cramped conditions with poor sanitation, and no safety net, no clean water, will suffer most. They are less likely to be able to protect themselves from the virus, and less likely to withstand a sharp drop in income.\n\nUnchecked, the pandemic is likely to create even wider inequalities, amid extensive suffering.\n\nThe universality of the threat from this virus provides the most compelling argument there has ever been for universal and affordable access to health care.Actions to upgrade public health care, in every country, are especially urgent. WHO is leading efforts to ensure that all countries are equipped to trace, isolate and treat people infected by COVID-19. This effort should be fully resourced. There will need to be a significant regional and global effort to avoid the collapse of any country's medical system – a matter of urgent interest to everyone.\n\nExtensive economic and social measures must also be taken, in every country, tolessen the shocks of this epidemic, and minimize the further growth of inequalities.The full impact of the pandemic on global and national economies has yet to be felt. Many States in every region – especially in Europe – have taken unprecedented measures to protect the rights of workers and minimize the numbers of those made unemployed. All States with sufficient resources should be encouraged to do the same.\n\nMany developing countries have less capacity to absorb and mitigate the economic and social impact of the epidemic. They may also be most vulnerable to world recession, through commodities pricing and a decline in foreign investment and of remittances, among other factors. The Secretary-General has called for measures including – but not limited to – debt alleviation, expanded access to funding through the IMF, and contributions to the Global Humanitarian Fund.\n\nWe may also need to explore new financial mechanisms to fund global solidarity. Last week the African Development Bank raised the world's largest social bond: a 3 billion US dollar fund to assist African governments to expand access to health and to other essential services and goods. This is precisely the kind of innovative thinking we need.\n\nI also want to emphasize the imperative of respect for civil and political rights during this crisis.\n\nDifficult decisions are facing many Governments. Emergency measures may well be needed to respond to this public health emergency. But an emergency situation is not a blank check to disregard human rights obligations.\n\nEmergency measures should be necessary and proportionate to meet that need. People should be fully informed about the emergency measures and told how long they will remain in effect. The enforcement of emergency measures needs to be applied fairly and humanely. Any penalties should be proportional to the offence committed and laid down by law.\n\nI am profoundly concerned by certain countries' adoption of emergency powers that are unlimited and not subject to review. In a few cases, the epidemic is being used to justify repressive changes to regular legislation, which will remain in force long after the emergency is over.\n\nI am also concerned by steps taken to impose restrictions on media freedom and freedom of expression. Vaguely formulated actions to combat alleged \"misinformation\" could be applied to any criticism, and in some countries we have already seen reports of journalists being penalized for reporting a lack of masks; health-workers reprimanded for saying they lack protection; and ordinary people arrested for social media postings about the pandemic.  Criticism is not a crime.\n\nI urge all Governments to greatly increase access to accurate information and statistics. Transparency is paramount and can be life-saving in a health crisis. I also urge an end to any blanket Internet and telecommunication shutdowns and denials of service.\n\nWhen members of military forces conduct law enforcement functions, they should be accountable to civilian authorities, and they remain subject to international human rights law.WHO strongly advises that health and social measures to combat COVID-19 be implemented with the full engagement of the public, because respect for human rights – including the rights to speak up, and to meaningfully participate in decisions – is an essential lever of successful public health policies. The only effective way to fight an epidemic is with the public's trust.\n\nWhat to do?\n\nI see two areas of action: the immediate response to the epidemic, and preparation of the recovery.\n\nRegarding the response, I want to share with you some action points that are immediately relevant and will assist in devising effective and humane policies.\n\n1. All national efforts should seek to mitigate the impact of the epidemic on women, and on vulnerable groups.\n\nWomenare more likely than men to work in low-wage and informal sectors, without paid sick leave, health insurance or social protection. Elderly women are also more likely than men to be subsisting without any form of pension. Confinement measures are creating additional burdens for many women, including the burden of caring for the sick, the elderly and children no longer attending school. Women and girls are also facing increased risks of domestic violence, as recent statistics from France and Spain have demonstrated. For purposes of remote schooling, girls globally have less access to Internet and cell-phones than boys. These impacts may not be immediately visible, but they could set back the cause of women's equality.\n\nSeveral high-risk and vulnerable groups require greater attention, and mitigation measures, at this time. They includepeople in places of detention and other institutions– including psychiatric institutions and orphanages;people with disabilities; indigenous peoples and minorities; migrants, refugees and internally displaced people; people in conflict zones; and, in particular, older people, especially those living alone or in institutions.\n\nSpecific guidance on most of these areas has been issued or is in preparation.\n\nNotably, I refer you to our guidance regardingpeople in detention facilities,whose number should be carefully reduced, to avoid an explosive spread of the virus in closed and overcrowded settings. Iran recently took action to release, at least temporarily, 40% of its prison population. Indonesia will also release prisoners accused of minor crimes. And so on, with other countries. I urge all states to release all those detained without a lawful basis, including those held in violation of human rights obligations. I am also concerned that some countries envision prison sentences for violating orders on physical distancing: this is likely to exacerbate the epidemic.\n\nPeople with disabilitiesmust often rely on others for help with daily tasks, and confinement regulations should ensure that support is available.\n\nManymigrantsare at very high risk of contagion, because of their living conditions and limited access to healthcare. I commend Portugal for taking action last week to temporarily grant all migrants in the country full citizenship rights, to enable them to access all healthcare systems.\n\n2 Extensive measures must be taken in every country to absorb the economic and social shocks of this epidemic, and to minimize the expansion of inequalities.\n\nEverywhere, the pandemic is likely to takea disproportionate toll on the poor.For example, information from the Catalan regional authorities, in Spain, indicates that residents of poorer neighbourhoods may be six or seven times more likely to contract the virus than people in richer areas.\n\nThere is a strong need for governmental action to ensure income security, the protection of livelihoods, and access to essential goods and services for the poorest members of society. It is vital to prevent people from becoming homeless as a result of losing their jobs. Cash grants should be envisioned, alongside measures to ensure families can delay rental or loan payments, and a halt to evictions. For the homeless, and others without adequate housing, measures could include using short-term rentals and emergency accommodation.\n\nMy Office is currently compiling good economic and social practices adopted by countries in every region – many of them developing countries – and we will bring these to your attention. We will also be working to integrate human rights into all the work of the UN's economic and social programs.3.Protection of health-workersand their adequate remuneration should be a paramount concern. To note, 70% of the world's health-workers are women, many of whom may be facing the additional burdens I have noted.\n\n4. When an existential threat faces all of us, there isno place for nationalism or scapegoating– including of migrants and minority communities. There have been growing, and unacceptable, physical and verbal attacks on people of East Asian origin, and members of other minorities, and action should be taken to combat this. As a matter of fact, Westerners too are sometimes targeted for abuse, including in our missions.\n\n5. In every stage of this epidemic – including the recovery – efforts should be made to involveNational Human Rights Institutions, civil society activistsand human rights defenders. Those with long-standing involvement in economic and social rights, urban communities and specific vulnerable groups, such as indigenous peoples, have gained many valuable lessons that can benefit all policy-makers today.\n\n6. Any obstacle to medical efforts in one country heightens the risk for all of us. Sectoralsanctionswhich have negative impacts on health care and the human rights of vulnerable people should urgently be lifted or adapted, with effective humanitarian exemptions to ensure access to vital supplies.\n\n7. I commend the efforts underway to ensure the Human Rights Council can assist in a timely manner with Covid-related human rights concerns. Under your leadership, Madam President, the Council is resuming its work. In addition to this informal briefing, a series of e-meetings with various stakeholders is being planned, and I understand there are discussions regarding a special session on COVID-19. I have been grateful for the swift and pertinent analyses of many Special Procedures mandate holders and and Chairs of Treaty Bodies.\n\nThroughout the response and recovery stages of the epidemic, we must all step up and demonstrateglobal solidarity. In this context, I remind all States of the duty of international cooperation and assistance under Article 2 of the Convention on Economic, Social and Cultural rights.\n\nBefore concluding, I want to make a few remarks about recovery from this crisis.\n\nAs the Secretary-General has highlighted, we must build back better. No country was prepared for this shock, which in every State has been exacerbated by inequalities, particularly in access to health-care, social protections and public services.\n\nThe epidemic has clarified the need to increase our efforts toensure that all people, including the most vulnerable, benefit from development. We need to redouble efforts to build more inclusive and sustainable economies, and to shape societies that are more resilient in the face of shocks. The 2030 Agenda is fully mapped and universally approved: it remains our strongest tool.\n\nIt should also be clear thatprotecting the environment,ensuring biodiversity,is the best way to protect human health and wellbeing, including from pandemics. Environmental degradation and biodiversity loss create the conditions for the type of animal-to-human zoonosis that has repeatedly resulted in vital epidemics. Not only Covid-19 – you will remember SARS, MERS and Ebola are also a result of zoonosis, so we need to ensure respect for the environment.\n\nWe simply cannot return to where we were just a few months ago, before COVID-19.\n\nThis is a colossal test of leadership. It demands decisive, coordinated and innovative action from all, and for all.  We are physically distant today, but we must stand together.\n\nAll of you have received a letter informing you of the work being undertaken by my Office in the context of COVID 19, and I will provide regular updates to you as the situation evolves. I take this opportunity to publicly thank all my staff for their continued determination and work at this challenging time.\n\nThank you Madam President"}]}

Accurate and complete vital statistics – derived from civil registration records – are critical to developing national and local policies and measuring development outcomes.\n\nCivil Registration also provides evidence of people's names, family relationships, the number of births and causes of deaths of different population groups. This is important for social protection, enabling participation in economic and political life, and for accessing services like healthcare and education.\n\nCivil Registration is about acknowledging invisible lives and recognizing those who remain outside the picture painted by official statistics. As such, Civil Registration aims to implement the SDG vision of 'leaving no-one behind' and is critical to Viet Nam's progress towards the attainment of the Sustainable Development Goals.\n\nMore than a quarter, 45 to be precise, of the 169 SDG targets will require data from the CRVS system, primarily in the form of population data as denominators for population-based targets. This remains a challenge since it is estimated that at least 135 million children in Asia and the Pacific are not officially registered or counted – with some countries in the region registering and indicating fewer than one in every ten children under the age of five.\n\nSimilarly, up to nine in ten of all global deaths are estimated to either not be registered or are inaccurately certified.\n\nLadies & Gentlemen,\n\nThe United Nations in Viet Nam has been supporting the development of Viet Nam's Civil Registration and Vital Statistics for over a decade in a number of ways. Technical support has been provided for the revision of laws, circulars, as well as birth registration and cause-of-death registration, particularly for vulnerable groups such as children, migrants, ethnic minorities and people living with disabilities.\n\nMost recently, WHO with the support of UNFPA and UNICEF provided support to the Government of Viet Nam in developing the action plan we are launching today. The UN Agencies also facilitated the participation of Viet Nam in international meetings and forums on CRVS.\n\nWith the action plan in hand, Viet Nam now has a strategy to build a well-functioning CRVS system and to meet the commitment it made during the 2014 Asia-Pacific Ministerial Conference on CRVS. This includes setting national targets under the Regional Action Framework and working towards achieving these targets over the Asian and Pacific CRVS Decade by 2024.\n\nViet Nam must make sure its CRVS system is used to provide information and evidence for the formulation and implementation of policies across the country in the areas of health, social protection, education, population and human rights.\n\nThe realization of the shared vision to get everyone in the picture will depend, however, on coordinated and concerted efforts to develop and enhance the capacities of the government of Viet Nam in achieving three key goals, notably:\n\na. Universal registration in all 63 provinces;\n\nb. Full legal documentation; and\n\nc. Comprehensive vital statistics based on civil registrations.\n\nThese action areas must serve as a basis for the Government of Viet Nam and development partners to focus and organize efforts towards implementing and supporting the comprehensive multi-sectoral national CRVS action plan, including delineating the responsibilities of involved stakeholders.\n\nI am pleased to learn that the first meeting of the National Steering Committee will be held this afternoon. It demonstrates Viet Nam's political commitment and the will of different actors to coordinate policies and legislation across different line ministries.\n\nThe National Steering Committee is a vital body for the implementation of the Action Plan. The committee must build bridges across line ministries, provide guidance and oversight and advocate for sustainable investments in civil registration and vital statistics.\n\nWhile the UN is committed to helping Viet Nam to bring together all partners at national, provincial and communal level, we wish to propose a joint working session of the National Steering Committee and the United Nations in Viet Nam in the short run in order to better coordinate both our actions and technical support to different stakeholders.\n\nIn closing, I wish to emphasize that while we are talking about developing vital statistics, we must never forget that behind every number is a person who defines our common humanity and deserves our compassion.\n\nThe United Nations in Viet Nam stands ready to work closely together with different line ministries to implement the comprehensive, multi-sectoral national CRVS strategy."}]}

This collaboration is part of the One Strategic Plan to be jointly delivered by the Government of Viet Nam and United Nations for the period 2017-2021. The project will further complement and strengthen joint programming efforts of UN agencies, particularly UNICEF and WHO, under the health output of the One Strategic Plan.\n\nLadies and gentlemen,\n\nThe 1994 International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) in Cairo, to which the government of Viet Nam is a signatory, was a milestone in the history of population and development, as well as reproductive rights and women's rights to health. At the conference, the world agreed that population is not just about numbers or counting people, but about making sure that every person counts and has access to quality reproductive health care including voluntary family planning services. Since ICPD, countries around the world, including Viet Nam, have invested a significant amount of resources for improving access to and utilization of sexual and reproductive health services. ICPD now forms part of the development agendas, such as of poverty reduction, women’s rights and sustainable development and reducing the strain on the environment in many countries, including Viet Nam.\n\nWe are all aware and proud of Viet Nam’s achievement of most MDGs, including MDG5 on reducing maternal mortality. However, while achievements must be sustained, wide disparities and inequities in access to and utilization of sexual and reproductive health services between urban and rural areas, geographical zones and vulnerable groups still remain and both need to and will be addressed in the national socio-economic development plan and in the context of Agenda 2030 with the ultimate goal of achieving the SDGs and leaving absolutely no one behind.\n\nLet me highlight three key issues today:\n\nFirst, access to sexual and reproductive health for disadvantaged groups:\n\nAccording to the 2014 Inter-census Population Survey, young people aged 10 to 24, accounted for approximately 22 million of a total population of over 90 million in the country in 2014[1]. Updated evidence from the national survey on sexual and reproductive health among adolescents conducted in 2016 indicated that unmet need for modern contraceptives is as high as 30% amongst unmarried young people. It is clear that gaps have existed in the provision of adolescent sexual and reproductive health services in policies and programs of the Ministry of Health for many years.\n\nIt is estimated that a high number of unwanted pregnancies occur every year as a consequence of high discontinuation rates, high contraceptive failure rates and high unmet need of quality modern family planning services among certain groups in the population. Bridging these gaps in access and provision of SRH services, particularly for young people, will help each person to pursue his or her interests and fulfill their potential. Investing in young people's health and development will also help the country to reap long term socio-economic gains.\n\nSecond, cervical cancer prevention:\n\nCervical cancer is now a key focus in the area of sexual and reproductive health for Vietnam. The number of deaths from cervical cancer can be as high as 2500-2700 each year in the country. That is to say, 10 cervical cancer-related deaths occurred yesterday and 10 will occur today. We have the evidence showing that access to the HPV vaccine for young girls and effective early screening can significantly reduce these numbers. However, HPV vaccines, though successfully piloted, are not yet widely utilized. In addition, HPV vaccination and early screening of cervical cancer are not yet covered by the current national health insurance package. This poses a major barrier in preventing 10 more Vietnamese women from dying tomorrow and the next day and the next as a result of this, largely preventable, deadly disease.\n\nThird, evidence based policy development: Another key focus of the project in this cycle is to generate quality evidence and develop laws, policies and guidelines on sexual and reproductive health and rights. At this point, I would like to address that while we are trying to improve the quality of generated data, application of updated evidence in laws, policy and programme development and implementation is vital. In addition, given the diverse needs of the population, one-size-fits-all policies do not work. Therefore, we need to ensure that the design of all laws, policies and guidelines include the participation of  the people whose needs they are meant to address, and that the results of these laws and investments can be implemented and monitored at local levels.\n\nLadies and gentlemen,\n\nAs we gather here today to discuss programme priorities and implementation strategies of the project for the period 2017-2021, I would like to highlight the following key messages:\n\nA focus on developing and monitoring a human rights’ based approach in sexual and reproductive health service provision where all citizens including disadvantaged groups such as youth and unmarried migrants have the ability to make well informed choices as a result of receiving quality services. MOH must take a leading role on this important issue.\n\nAmbitious work is being undertaken by the government to achieve sustainable health care financing and universal health coverage. This financing must include universal access to the HPV vaccine and early cervical cancer screening as well as other vital sexual and reproductive health services.\n\nLastly, effective implementation and monitoring of national policy at the local level.  UNFPA, together with UNICEF, WHO and other UN partners, stands committed to support the Government of Viet Nam in achieving this vision of universal access to an integrated package of quality sexual and reproductive health services in every commune and district of the country. Furthermore, this vision will be stronger if a united and multi-sectoral approach is taken on healthcare issues, which involves a strong partnership between the public and private sector as well as CSOs.\n\nFinally, I would like to thank the Ministry of Health for its ongoing efforts to work with us in the past year to develop and finalize the concept note, PIP and project document so that we can come together and launch the project today. I look forward to working closely with all of you in effectively responding to sexual and reproductive health priorities and needs of the Vietnamese people and contributing to the achievement of the national sustainable development goals.\n\nThank you very much for your attention and participation. I wish you all good health, happiness and success.\n\n[1] GSO. Inter-Censal Population Survey 2014."}]}

Julien Guerrier, Ambassador of the European Union to Viet Nam\n\nPartners and colleagues, Ms. Ramla Khalidi, UNDP Representative,\n\nDistinguished Guests,\n\nIt is a privilege to represent the United Nations in Viet Nam at this Legal Partnership Forum, a high-level dialogue between the Government of Viet Nam, the United Nations, the European Union, and development partners, to discuss how our collective efforts could contribute to strengthen the rule of law for the new period as envisioned in Resolution 27.\n\nOur enduring partnership with Viet Nam is a testament to the power of unity—rooted in mutual respect, shared goals, and common values. It is a partnership that has matured through trust and steadfast collaboration across UN agencies, the Ministry of Justice, and the legal and judicial bodies of Viet Nam. Over the years, we have witnessed significant progress in legal and judicial reforms, which contributes to promotion and protection of human rights. In particular, the UN in Viet Nam commends the accomplishments of Resolutions 48 and 49 on strengthening legal system and judicial reforms.\n\nResolution 27 comes at a time of both challenges and opportunities. This resolution is instrumental in shaping upcoming years’ strategy, as it emphasizes a strong socialist rule-of-law state guided by the principles of transparency, inclusiveness, and justice. Resolution 27 stands more than a policy directive—it is a commitment to the Vietnamese people, envisioning a society where rights are safeguarded, with transparent governance, and an equitable legal framework.\n\nWith the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the SDGs as our compass, the UN’s partnership with Viet Nam is anchored in a strong and shared commitment to ensure that no one is left behind. The New Vision of the Secretary-General for the Rule of Law, and the UN in Viet Nam's Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework (CF) for 2022-2026, particularly the outcome on Governance and Access to Justice, align with Viet Nam’s strategic objectives and puts people at the core of governance, fostering transparency, and building a just, inclusive society.\n\nI wish to highlight the shared core values and priorities of Resolution 27, the New Vision of the Secretary-General for the Rule of Law and the UN-GoV Cooperation Framework, which underpins our discussions today:\n\nFirst, Upholding Rule of Law and Protection of Rights:\n\nResolution 27 and the UN-GoV Cooperation Framework both reaffirm the commitment to uphold the rule of law, spotlighting the need for transparent governance, human and citizens' rights, judicial fairness, and accountability mechanisms.\n\nSecond, Strengthening Institutions and Enhancing Democracy:\n\nResolution 27 highlights renovation and improved efficiency of the National Assembly, modernizing state administration, and building a professional judiciary. It emphasizes the importance of empowering the people and enhancing the role of the Viet Nam Fatherland Front. In harmony with these aims, the UN-GoV Cooperation Framework advocates for the empowerment and responsiveness of institutions, emphasizes policies and reforms that benefit the whole society.\n\nThird, Integrity and the Fight Against Corruption:\n\nAligned with Resolution 27's targeted efforts against corruption, the UN-GoV Cooperation Framework commits to supporting the development and implementation of mechanisms to prevent corruption and upholding governance integrity, thereby ensuring equal opportunities for all.\n\nFourth, Capacity Building, Awareness, and International Collaboration:\n\nBoth Resolution 27 and the UN-GoV Cooperation Framework stress the value of promoting public awareness about governance and rights, and call for international integration, cooperation, and multi-stakeholder collaboration.\n\nAs we move forward, we must be aware of the challenges and continually evaluate the impact of our policies. It is equally important to ensure that reforms resonate at the grassroots, guaranteeing that every citizen, regardless of their location or socio-economic background, share their benefits.\n\nAs we delve deeper in our dialogue today, I suggest our discussions center on:\n\nOne, inclusivity:Ensure our strategies embody the spirit of “leaving no one behind”\n\nTwo, people-centred:Policies and reforms should align with and reflect the needs of the people.\n\nThree, collaboration:foster collaboration among all stakeholders to mobilize collective wisdom and further propel Viet Nam's progress.\n\nThe implementation of Resolution 27 translates into action our shared commitment -- to ensure that by 2026, every individual in Viet Nam, especially vulnerable groups, not only benefits from but actively contributes to creating a nation that's just, safe, and inclusive.\n\nIn closing, my deepest appreciation goes to the Ministry of Justice, our steadfast partner in this journey, and to the EU Delegation in Viet Nam for your unwavering support through the Justice and Legal Empowerment Programme (EU JULE). We join hands in this important journey towards a brighter, just, and inclusive future.\n\nThank you! Xin cam on!"}]}

This was recognized by the Prime Minister in his recent conversation with me and in his speech last week at the National Conference on Natural Disaster Prevention and Control where he said that Viet Nam is one of the ten most vulnerable countries in the world. I know that the people in this room today are probably more knowledgeable than anyone about how this reality plays out year after year in terms of natural disasters. Recently, we have witnessed the extensive El-Nino induced drought and salt water intrusion in 2015-2016, and the intense storm seasons of 2017 and 2018 - these disasters highlighted the devastating impacts of both slow and sudden-onset natural disasters in Viet Nam, and how the most vulnerable groups such as the poor, children, women, and ethnic minorities often are amongst the most severely affected.\n\nThe UN has been working in Viet Nam for over 40 years, seeking to contribute to a Vietnamese society which is greener, healthier, better educated, and more inclusive and empowered to reach its full potential within the overall framework of the UN's 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Meeting the challenges posed by the impacts of climate change and natural disasters requires a broad range of responses across sectors, levels of government, and organizations. With these objectives in mind, the work of 18 UN entities operating in Viet Nam is brought together through the common partnership framework, the \"One Strategic Plan\" for 2017-2021, which strives for a United Nations which works for all, tirelessly striving to Leave No One Behind.\n\nDisaster Response Management is one of the areas where the UN can truly excel as One, acting together to use the talents and expertise of the UN Agencies in Viet Nam to bring about timely life-saving assistance. The UN in Viet Nam carried out two large-scale responses under the Central Emergency Response Fund from 2016 to 2018, which saw us working closely with the Government, NGOs and Viet Nam Red Cross and other partners to reach more than half a million beneficiaries. Activities addressed the most urgent and live-saving needs for water and sanitation, health, nutrition, food security, and shelter to ensure that those facing the most severe impacts of droughts and typhoons could avoid falling into crisis, recover and rebuild their livelihoods.\n\nWhat followed the response efforts were some processes in which we as a One UN family looked back to examine what worked and what needed improvement in how the response was carried out. While there were many lessons learned and activities initiated to improve future responses, one of the key messages received was that speeding up the delivery and efficiency of assistance to more vulnerable beneficiaries was essential.\n\nWorking with a small budget under the UNDG (now UNSDS) /DOCO (now DCO) Delivering Together for Sustainable Development Facility (DTF), this project set out to find ways to reduce the crucial gap between the time when a storm makes landfall and when high-level officials have the information they need to make informed decisions about whether to give the green light for action. In the era of social media and digital technologies, there is an essential need to improve data preparedness, real time data collection and use of geographic information for timely monitoring of humanitarian impacts, tracking of early action, and targeting resource needs. This project represents a collective effort across the One UN to gather the necessary data in all 63 provinces and build, refine and test the tools to use data more effectively, speed up processes and get assistance in place as soon as possible. It is therefore with pleasure that we share these tools today.\n\nI wish to acknowledge the efforts of all UN staff and agencies that supported the Data Layering for Disaster Preparedness Project which was led by the UN Disaster Response Management Team's working group under the leadership of UNDP which did a lot of the work and should be congratulated for this. This project shows that significant strategic impact can be made with very modest resources, something I have seen in many projects that I have initiated, such as this one and I am therefore happy to witness this result again. I understand that it is Jenty's last few days in UNDP Viet Nam, or her last week, so allow me to particularly highlight her contribution to this project and more broadly and wish her well in her new assignment. On behalf of the UN in Viet Nam, I would also like to thank the Viet Nam Disaster Management Authority for our excellent continuing partnership. With the support of the people of Viet Nam, and in collaboration with all partners whom I also wish to thank, we will continue to strive for a United Nations which works for all, tirelessly striving to Leave No One Behind.\n\nAs we unfortunately move into a future which is likely to have more frequent and intense hazard events, I welcome the efforts of all key relevant partners who have gathered here today to learn from the past and to forge stronger partnerships for the future.\n\nXin Cảm Ơn!"}]}

Their expertise has been instrumental in ensuring that the revised indicators are robust, relevant and reflective of both the global agenda and local priorities.\n\nViet Nam's journey towards sustainable development has been inspiring, showcasing dedication at every level of society. Since the adoption of the National Action Plan in 2017 and the creation of the Vietnam Sustainable Development Statistical Indicators (VSDGIs), substantial progress has been made on achieving several SDGs, such as poverty reduction, health, education, and clean energy as highlighted in the recent government report on SDG implementation. For instance, the multidimensional poverty rate has declined significantly, and access to clean water has improved dramatically, with more than 98% of households now using improved water sources. Effective policies, infrastructure development, and your collective efforts have all contributed to making good progress.\n\nFrom a United Nations perspective, we are pleased to see the renewed commitment to the 2030 Agenda through the new roadmap for sustainable development. Importantly, this roadmap includes revisions of indicators to further align national efforts with global SDG indicators to allow for better international comparison and to respond to Viet Nam's unique development needs and priorities.\n\nToday’s consultation workshop is an important part of the journey on last-mile efforts towards a shared vision of a sustainable, equitable and resilient future for all. The revised indicators, with disaggregated data, allow for better understanding of inequalities, and help to effectively address issues facing vulnerable population groups such as children, women, ethnic minorities, and people with disabilities. This is how we will leave no one behind. The revised indicators are not an endpoint but a step forward in our shared journey towards sustainable development.\n\nI am pleased to return to Ha Long City and to see how quickly it has recovered from the terrible damage caused by typhoon Yagi. The UN is supporting the government of Viet Nam’s response, and our thoughts are with those impacted by the disaster. In both humanitarian and development settings, SMART indicators are used to measure progress and compile data. These statistics are not just numbers – they tell human stories. They speak about people’s health and well-being, their prospects, ambitions and socio-economic circumstances. When collected and analyzed, statistics can tell us where policies have worked, where people have benefited and help us to see those at risk of being left behind. Quality data in humanitarian settings is even more crucial for informed decision-making that minimises risks, saves lives and optimises resources.\n\nIn consideration of the importance of SMART indicators and corresponding data, while my UN colleague, Bui Linh, will elaborate on key issues we are currently facing in Viet Nam, I count on your continued efforts to further reform the existing indicators and data collection systems toward aligning with the international SDGI framework, responding to local needs and priorities-particularly addressing vulnerability and exclusion of left behind groups, and ensuring that they are reflected in strategic plans and strategies.\n\nI want to close by thanking you for your dedication, partnership and commitment to leaving no one behind. I am confident that through our collective action, we will enhance our ability to measure progress, respond to challenges, and ultimately, make a meaningful difference in the lives of people across Viet Nam.\n\nI wish you a productive workshop.Xin cảm ơn and Thank You All."}]}

First of all, I would like to thank the GSO leaders for inviting the UN’s contribution to GSO’s important work on GDP revision. This work is strategic for Viet Nam since the economy is transforming in an accelerated manner as a result both of the government’s huge efforts and the increasing role of the private sector and its dynamism. The GDP revision process requires that all economic, social and environmental aspects need to be reflected in official statistics in a comprehensive, consistent and coherent manner.\n\nDistinguished participants,\n\nCountries make some revisions to their GDP computations from time to time in order to adopt new statistical systems, include new census and survey data or because of improvements in their data sources. More specifically, there may be new data from surveys such as the business enterprise census, agricultural census, rural census or other administrative data which can be collected from the national tax administration and line ministries and require updates in GDP figures based on the improvements in these surveys and censuses.\n\nFurthermore, there may be methodological improvements in the estimation of GDP figures. In recent years, countries have started to revise their national accounts by switching their national accounting methodologies to the 2008 System of National Accounts (SNA). More specifically, the adoption of the 2008 SNA system necessitates some changes in concepts and scope, methodology, valuation and classification such as the capitalization of R&D and weapons systems, calculation of Financial Intermediation Services Indirectly Measured (FISIM), development of new Supply and Use Tables (SUT) and change in the base year.\n\nViet Nam’s economy has exhibited high growth rates in the last decade and the structure of the economy is significantly changing as a result of this dynamic process. The role of FDI as well as ICT in the economy is significantly rising, which creates a huge potential for domestic enterprises to access global production networks. This transformation in the economy should be taken into account in statistical terms, by adopting the most recent international statistical methodologies, standards and techniques to estimate the resulting economic shift in a better manner.\n\nIt is expected that these changes may result in GDP level size shifts but not have any impact on growth rates. For example, the reassessment of GDP in the Republic of Korea in 2014 increased the volume of GDP by 6.7 percent in nominal terms, but it affected the annual GDP growth rate by only 0.3 percentage points between 2000 and 2012. In the case of Kenya, the impact of GDP revision in 2014 on the nominal GDP level was 21 percent but its impact on real GDP growth was only 2.4 percent between 2006-2013.\n\nThe UN wishes to recognize the work of GSO in making the GDP revision by (i) filling in the missing data and incorporating updated information (from recent censuses and surveys), (ii) its efforts to align with the UN SNA2008 and (iii) its efforts to involve the IMF and the UN in the exercise to ensure that the revision is transparent and in line with international standards and practices. Noting that making regular GDP revision and rebasing are necessary: because GDP remains the most popular measurement, despite its many imperfections, the accuracy of GDP helps not just governments in macro-economic management but also market players in planning and doing their businesses.\n\nBut GDP revision should be viewed as just the first step. The next steps should include: (i) ensuring horizontal coherence by making the GDP revision in a consistent series (of the past years), (ii) collecting quality data and making quality GDP estimates while establishing the new base year, (iii) conducting GDP revisions more regularly, and transparently, at least once every 5 years (to avoid big jumps in number such as in this case) including by continuing to engage international organizations such as the UN and (iv) conducting pro-active communication to provide the public with clear and transparent explanations on the nature and scope of the changes.\n\nMore GDP revisions will need to be done in the future and more regularly. This is because economies and the world are changing rapidly. Manufacturing and agriculture made up more than half of national output in industrial countries in the early 20th century but now they make up far less, with the rest consisting of services. Measuring value added in manufacturing and agriculture production is much simpler than in services or the data we access through the internet (which has become more valuable than oil these days): There are significant difficulties in, for example, deciding whether to classify a Grab driver as an “own account”(household) business or worker of Grab while estimating the environmental costs of production pose challenges to statisticians in the world but are essential if we wish to make GDP a more accurate measurement.\n\nGDP revision related communications are critical because: (i) building public trust and support for official statistics is important in the world of social media and biased judgements; (ii) clear communication is necessary to ensure that users (researchers and policy makers) understand and use the national account data correctly.\n\nIt is particularly important to also effectively communicate with policy makers: Viet Nam relies too much on simple rules on macro-economic and fiscal targets which is problematic because its institutions have limited capacity. This poses the risk of the large GDP revision (like this) making impacts on the real economy, through such rules, and thus there is a risk of viewing the GDP revision – a necessary and good work of GSO - as “negative”. There is a need, therefore, for better and more flexible rules/targets (say targets with wider ranges and escape clauses – for example a GDP growth target of 6-7.5% or government extra borrowing being allowed in recessions) and (b) stronger institutions for macro-economic and fiscal management.\n\nIt is also critical that the government of Viet Nam does not use the revised GDP figures in the context of pre-existing fiscal rules and regulations and national macroeconomic targets. The previous GDP should, instead, be used to evaluate the performance of these targets. Otherwise, building trust and communicating better will be very difficult and the credibility of the GDP revision will be questioned by the public.\n\nThe UN in Viet Nam has contributed to the GDP revision by focusing on sharing international experiences and best international standards in the construction of the national accounting system and GDP. In this context, the UN research paper “Revisions to National Accounts: International Experiences and Vietnamese Practices” which was shared with GSO, was commissioned quickly by the UN RCO and the UNDP in Viet Nam under my direct strategic guidance. This paper provides a diverse set of international experiences related to national account revisions, highlights their likely impact on macroeconomic and fiscal dimensions of the economy and provides suggestions on how to make the current GDP revision more satisfactory in Viet Nam’s political economy context.\n\nThe UN has a long history of support to the national statistical system. More broadly, the UN in Viet Nam has been providing significant support to statistical development at both a systemic overarching level and in thematic statistics areas such as the development of the Viet Nam Statistical Development Strategy, the Law on Statistics, different surveys including Viet Nam Living Standard Survey, the Enterprise Survey, the population census and women, children and disability related surveys. We will continue to support Viet Nam in collecting quality and timely data for GDP estimation in particular and SDG monitoring and reporting in general, through the work of the UN country team in Viet Nam as well as through UNESCAP and UNSD in DESA in New York.\n\nThe UN in Viet Nam will continue to help Viet Nam with regular updates to its GDP in a transparent manner as it should be normal and periodically necessary.\n\nI thank you! Xin cảm ơn!"}]}

I'm particularly pleased today to see this collaboration reach out to the business sector whose role is increasingly critical in Viet Nam.\n\nAs you all know, Viet Nam has made remarkable socio-economic progress over the past decades, moving from a poor to an emerging middle income country while achieving most Millennium Development Goals. Today, Viet Nam needs to prioritize sustainable economic growth and the business sector will need to play an increasing role in contributing to this. However, especially in our climate vulnerable world, the economy cannot be considered in a vacuum, as a single pillar conditioning the prosperity of the country. The economy must also be more inclusive to ensure equitable sharing of the gains across society. The economy must be greener to ensure that growing environmental risks but also untapped environmental opportunities are properly factored into business models. In the past decades, the environment in Viet Nam has significantly degraded and can threaten successful implementation of SDGs as well as the sustainability of Viet Nam's economic growth itself. Reconciling the environment, growth and development agendas in Viet Nam will, therefore, be key to both its future success and its achievement of Agenda 2030 (the SDGs).\n\nAt the global level, the United Nations has actively engaged with the biggest international corporations to spearhead the fight against climate change and move them to contribute to the sustainability of societies in a more systemic and significant manner. Many leaders of international corporations are making commitments and taking concrete actions to integrate the environment and forests into sustainable extraction, production, transport or consumption models. The time has now come for the Vietnamese business sector, from large corporations to small and medium sized companies, to also engage proactively in this dynamic, or run the risk of being locked into unproductive and unsustainable models.\n\nLast year, the Government of Viet Nam concluded negotiations with the European Union on a Voluntary Partnership Agreement for Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade. This is an excellent illustration. This is an important move forward for the Government of Viet Nam, creating opportunities for its USD 7 billion timber industry to sustainably access and better penetrate big export markets in the European Union. But it also comes with challenges for the business sector to ensure traceability and sustainability throughout its supply chain, to improve production models, to invest in more effective technologies, to turn to new plantation models, and to strengthen its trading relations regionally and worldwide\n\nLadies and gentlemen,\n\nThis event aims at promoting engagement of the business sector with forestry issues. But forests are not just timber but also encompass agriculture, water, energy, roads and other infrastructure, health, building and construction industries. All these sectors are supported directly and indirectly by goods and services extracted from forests. The very paper that I used to write this speech comes from fibers from the forests. Forests are everywhere. But forests are under increasing pressure. Even in Viet Nam. The country has been extremely successful in increasing its national forest cover from 27% in 1993 to 41% in 2015, but at the same time the country has continued to degrade and deplete its natural forests at an alarming rate, and by doing so, it has also undermined many opportunities for its future sustainable development.\n\nThere is good news, however. On January 12th this year, the Communist Party released Directive 13 calling for massive and multi-stakeholder mobilization to sustainably manage forests. The directive underscores \"the wrong mindset of compromising sustainable development for immediate economic benefits\", and regrets that \"the privatization of forest management, protection and development reveal shortcomings\". It also \"encourages socialization and incentivizing mechanisms, together with creating favorable conditions to facilitate the participation of individuals and enterprises in forest management, protection and development\". The way people in Viet Nam are looking at forests is changing, in the administration, in companies, in the street.\n\nThe United Nations has partnered with the Government of Viet Nam to assist with this transformation. I would like to highlight the full commitment of the United Nations to work as a strategic partner with Viet Nam on climate change and environmental issues. As part of the UN-REDD Programme and with support from Norway, we have been successfully assisting the Government to turn the call for coordination and mobilization into actions and results. As the Prime Minister is in the process of considering the new National REDD+ Action Programme, new programmatic directions and new institutional arrangements are being secured to turn these directions into practice. The Ministry of Investment and Planning, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Industry and Trade, Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment, State Bank of Viet Nam and MARD and now reaching out to all relevant Ministries to improve the business environment for the sustainable management of forests. Be there and seize the chance to make your business, the forest, and Viet Nam better!\n\nFor the business sector in Viet Nam, this means both more opportunities and responsibilities. In our fast changing world, success comes with innovation and leadership. I hope that today's space for dialogue triggers the change in mindsets and positive action in your business. Today, we are coming together, as a One coherent United Nations, with the Government and the business sector, with international partners like Norway, to open a very promising era of closer collaboration with the business sector on forest issues in Viet Nam. This is a major milestone, demonstrating increased awareness and momentum. I agreed to be present at this event in order to encourage the Government of Viet Nam and the business sector to deepen this fruitful dialogue and collaboration and turn it into practical action, including through innovations for new financial and fiscal mechanisms, and for improved norms and standards to enhance business sustainability and to incentivize early movers. Whatever your industry, I am convinced you will find many ways to better consider forest issues for growing your business more sustainably and impactfully.\n\nLadies and gentlemen,\n\nThe United Nations looks forward to continued close cooperation with the Government of Viet Nam and the business sector in order to realize this vision and the opportunities which come with it.\n\nThank you for your attention."}]}

Let me at the outset thank the General Office for Population and Family Planning (GOPFP) for hosting and organizing today's celebration.\n\nWorld Population Day is celebrated across the world on 11 July to focus global attention on some of the most pressing population issues of our time. And today we mark World Population Day with the theme of \"25 years of ICPD: Accelerating the Promise\".\n\nLadies and gentlemen,\n\n2019 is a landmark and exciting year for the United Nations Population Fund, the UN agency with a mandate on ensuring the best international practices on sexual and reproductive health. UNFPA turns 50 this year – a very special birthday. And the ICPD Programme of Action, which guides the work UNFPA does, turns 25. This is a happy coincidence and calls for a double celebration!\n\nICPD, of course, stands for the International Conference on Population and Development, which took place in Cairo in 1994. That was when 179 countries – including Viet Nam - came together to forge a Programme of Action on Population and Development. For the very first time, sustainable development was grounded in individual rights and choices, and the achievement of sexual and reproductive health for all.\n\nWhile the ICPD Programme of Action was revolutionary, marking a major paradigm shift in population and development, it wasn't born out of the blue.\n\nIn the 1970s, many governments, NGOs and development institutions began supplying an increasing quantity of reliable contraceptives to enable women to better manage their own fertility. But achieving targets – numerical targets - was the primary goal of many early family planning programmes, and this often compromised the quality of reproductive health services and, at times, violated the rights of women.\n\nBy 1994, however, a global consensus had emerged that women had a right to make their own decisions about whether, when and how often to become pregnant, and have children in safe environments.\n\nICPD built on that by clearly demonstrating how reproductive rights and sustainable development are mutually reinforcing. ICPD called for voluntary and rights-based comprehensive reproductive health care, including family planning, rather than fertility-controlled targets.\n\nBy placing individual rights and choices firmly at the centre of development, ICPD reflected the principles of the United Nations Charter, as well as the pillars of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which is the bedrock of all that the UN stands for.\n\nThe ICPD recognizes that reproductive health and women's empowerment are intertwined, and that both are necessary for the advancement of society.\n\nDistinguished guests,\n\nNow, since its signing in 2015, Viet Nam – along with the rest of the world – has embarked on the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, underpinned by the 17 Sustainable Development Goals, or SDGs. The Agenda and its Goals seek to achieve a life of dignity for all, in order to truly leave no one behind.\n\nOn behalf of the UN system, let me affirm our commitment to continue to be your partner in the full achievement of the ICPD Programme of Action, which is one of the pillars on whose success the 2030 agenda depends.\n\nUNFPA has set its sights on three ambitious aims for 2030:\n\nAll three are based on a foundation of high-quality population data. Data is crucial to ending the invisibility of those who have been left furthest behind. Our commitment to leaving no one behind means everyone must be accounted for, so everyone can be reached. We are very happy to inform you that the preliminary results of the 2019 Census on Population and Housing have been disseminated this morning by the General Statistics Office, with technical support from UNFPA, so my colleague Astrid Bant, UNFPA Representative, is there for that important event.\n\nLadies and gentlemen,\n\nThis November, UNFPA is convening governments, civil society and other supporters, at the Nairobi Summit on ICPD25, co-sponsored by Kenya and Denmark, where UNFPA will seek additional commitments to complete the unfinished business of ICPD - to help ensure no one is left behind in achieving sexual and reproductive health and rights for all.\n\nWomen and girls are counting on us to finish the unfinished business of rights and choices for all. We must honour our commitment – acknowledge the new realities, address the new dangers and embrace the new agenda.\n\nThe United Nations in Viet Nam is fully committed to supporting the Government in ensuring that universal access to health, including sexual and reproductive health, will become a reality for all. But, we cannot do this alone. Government, parliamentarians, the private sector and civil society must join forces to make it happen.\n\nAnd we need young persons, including those of you here today to be involved strongly in this effort. We often hear that \"young people are the future\" – but how often do we truly involve young persons in helping shape their own futures?\n\nThis includes providing genuinely comprehensive sexuality education at a young age, serving as a foundation for sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights – including family planning.\n\nTogether, by building partnerships between the government and civil society in Viet Nam and globally, we can build a future where zero is the only acceptable number: zero maternal deaths, zero unmet demand for family planning, and zero violence and harmful practices against women and girls.\n\nInvestments in sexual and reproductive health, including family planning today are investments in the health and well-being of millions of girls, women and young persons for generations to come. I urge the Government of Viet Nam to increase its investments in this area.\n\nThank you. I wish you all good health, happiness and success on this World Population Day – and always.\n\nThank you! Xin Cam On!"}]}

I am very happy to see so many of you here.\n\nI want to start off on a personal note.There are many things I love about my job. One is that everyday is an opportunity for me to learn. Today, its learning how to make UN and diplomats to dance without permission. Thank you DAV Music Club for the performance and showing how important it is to incorporate art and creative economy in unconventional solutions to SDGs.\n\nDistinguished guests, colleagues, friends,\n\nThe pandemic uprooted many long-held traditions and routines.Today, I’m excited that we can – after two years of without UN Day celebrations – that we can be here together.\n\nRe-igniting the UN Day celebrations provides an opportunity to reflect on the many profound changes that have taken place, look ahead and continue the conversations about the future we want.\n\nWe have crafted today’s event to build on Our Common Agenda, launched by the UN Secretary General in 2020.At the UN General Assembly held in August 2022, the Secretary General presented his report on Our Common Agenda. It provided a framework and an opportunity to unite the international community around solutions to the multiple crises affecting humanity.\n\nWhen the UN Secretary General, Mr António Guterres visted Viet Nam earlier this fall – and came to the Diplomatic Academy! – he spoke not only of ‘achieving the sustainable development agenda’, he spoke of ‘rescuing the SDGs’. In line with this,Our Common Agenda is first and foremost a booster shot for the Sustainable Development Goals,to get back on track for sustainable growth and resilience in today's very challenging circumstances.\n\nBut it also goes beyond the SDGs, addressing challenges and gaps in multilateral frameworks that have become more urgent since 2015. The ideas in the report fall into four broad categories:\n\nHere, I want to mention the Summit of the Future.The Summit is a high-level event will bring together UN Member States, UN agencies, non-governmental organizations, civil society organizations, academic institutions, the private sector, and youth under the theme, ‘Summit of the Future: Multilateral Solutions for a Better Tomorrow’. It aims to forge a new global consensus on what our future should look like, and what we can do today to secure it.This Summit is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to reinvigorate global action, recommit to fundamental principles, and further develop the frameworks of multilateralism so they are fit for the future. This Summit should maximize the booster effect for the 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals. Us meeting here today is an important opportunity to engage in meaningful discussions on our joint direction of travel, in line with the aspiration and goals of the Summit of the Future.\n\nIt is clear that we, as a community of practice, and as humanity need to do things differently. We need to adapt, be flexible, ramp up global solidarity and work closer and better together to propel the changes needed for an equitable and green future for all. We have, against this backdrop, invited Dr Otto Sharmer to give us a virtual keynote address. Dr Scharmer is the founder of the Precensing Institute and the U-school of Transformation, and a senior lecturer at MIT. He joins us from New York, and will speak to us about transformational leadership and awareness-based systems change.\n\nWe are excited to join forces with the Diplomatic Academy of Viet Nam on this special day.Findings solutions for the challenges of tomorrow requires the young generations’ active engagement.In the spirit of ‘nothing for youth, without youth’ we hope for this event to inspire the next generation of leaders and thinkers to engage in meaningful discussions around the future of multilateralism. Together, we wish to engage in dialogue around questions such as:\n\nI am eager to learn from you and commit to continue these dialogues on forging the “future we want.”\n\nThank you, Xin cam on!\n\n--\n\nThe recording link of the 2022 UN Day Celebration at DAV today, 13 December 2022:\n\nhttps://bit.ly/3PmAhQx\n\nPasscode: wuP962@*"}]}

The inspiration originated from “Five Billion Day” in 1987 – on the day when the world population reached 5 billion. In 1989, the Governing Council of the United Nations Development Programme established this special day as an annual event.\n\nToday, our human family is over 8 billion strong.\n\nData on population dynamics helps us to develop policies that prepare us for the future.\n\nGlobally, we must prepare for continued population growth in sub-Saharan Africa, while anticipating slow growth or even decline in much of Asia, Europe and Northern America, and subsequently in Latin America and the Caribbean.\n\nViet Nam’s population is now over 100 million, the 15th most populous country. According to projections by Viet Nam’s General Statistics Office, the population will continue to grow but at a gradually decreasing rate.\n\nTo mark World Population Day, we celebrate progress and achievements, and commit to redoubling our efforts to secure a sustainable future for all -- and to leave no one behind.\n\n30 years ago in Cairo, the International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) concluded with the promise of a vision to achieve people-centred development – with respect for people’s dignity and human rights – and placing sexual and reproductive health and rights at the core of sustainable development. This concept remains at the heart of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\n\nSince Cairo, we have achieved much progress globally. Fewer women die in pregnancy and childbirth. Risks of child mortality have fallen – across developed and developing countries. Access to reproductive healthcare services have expanded, including modern contraceptives. And adolescent births have declined by around a third.\n\nProgress, however, has been uneven, with some socio-economic groups benefitting, while others are left behind. Many countries still fall short of life expectancy targets. Many developing countries still face significant challenges in reaching the SDG target for child mortality. Globally, a quarter of women remain unable to make decisions about their own health care; and nearly 1 in 10 women have no choice over the use of contraception. Between 2016 and 2020, the global annual reduction in maternal death was zero. That means we saw no progress. Every day over 800 women die during pregnancy and childbirth from preventable causes.\n\nThe story of Viet Nam is one to celebrate. I congratulate Viet Nam for its efforts to address inequalities and to bridge disparities in socio-economic status between regions and population groups. Vietnamese people are living longer – a good sign of development. In health care, over the past 20 years, Viet Nam has surpassed the global 34% reduction in maternal mortality by achieving a 46% reduction.  The use of modern contraceptives among women aged 15 – 49 years has increased, with over 60% usage.\n\nNevertheless, disparities remain. The maternal mortality ratio in the remote ethnic minority regions is three to four times higher than the national average. Unmet needs for modern contraceptives by unmarried young people account for 40%, 4 times higher than for married couples.\n\nFindings of the National Transfer Accounts recently conducted by the General Statistics Office in collaboration with UNFPA show that Viet Nam is still in the “demographic window of opportunity” -- with an abundant young labour force until 2039. However, Viet Nam’s population has been ageing since 2011 and at a much faster rate than in other countries. Viet Nam is projected to become an aged population country by 2036 and ‘super-aged society by 2049. This demographic shift from a young to an aged society has multifaceted consequences at national, regional, and global levels.\n\nThis means we must start now to prepare for these demographic shifts and rapid population ageing. Solutions include increasing labour participation especially among the older population, supporting women remaining in the labour market, and investing in health and education.\n\nDistinguished guests,\n\nWe must also recognize the megatrends that are reshaping our world – climate change, demographic shifts, urbanization, digital technologies and inequalities – as well as their critical connections to the Sustainable Development Goals.\n\nWe must also understand that in a demographically diverse world, population dynamics, including differences in the pace of population growth or decline, changing population age structure, urbanisation and people’s mobility and migration, will continue to shape the world for present and future generations.\n\nThe upcoming Summit of the Future to be held in New York at the High-Level Week of the UN General Assembly offers us a chance to discuss these issues that shape our today and tomorrow. At the Summit, there will be a strong focus on youth and future generations. The Pact of the Future provides an opportunity for concrete, action-oriented commitments towards strengthening the meaningful participation of young people in decision-making at all levels, including at the United Nations, and to ensure that they have access to sustainable livelihoods and vital services, such as education, health and social protection.\n\nLooking to the Summit, we must prioritise the needs of future generations. This means pursuing a green and sustainable development pathway so that the next generation inherits a liveable planet. We must accelerate progress towards gender equality and the empowerment of women in all spheres of life. We must take immediate and bold action to ensure that every woman has access to the care and services she needs to survive pregnancy and childbirth. Investment in sexual and reproductive health and rights is investing in ending poverty and ending inequality. We cannot achieve our common goals if we leave half of humanity behind.\n\nLet us seize the opportunity of the 30th anniversary of the ICPD and the Summit of the Future to forge a brighter future where all people, everywhere can live in dignity, prosperity and hope.\n\nI wish you all good health and happiness.\n\nThank you! Xin cam on!"}]}

It’s a fundamental right – a right enshrined in international human rights law. Yet gender based violence against women and girls continues to be a serious problem in almost every country in the world.\n\nGlobally, one in every three women is subjected to violation by men, often close to her – father, husband, boyfriend, uncle, and supervisor, colleague at workplace, etc.\n\nIn Viet Nam, 58% of ever-married women said that they had experienced at least one form of physical, sexual and emotional violence from someone close, at some point in their lives.\n\n87% said they had been sexually harassed in public.\n\n10% said they had been sexually assaulted by their spouses.\n\nBut 87% of victims did not seek help due to the lack of available services. Many were also afraid to speak up due to the fear of stigma, discrimination and further harassment.\n\nWe need to create an enabling environment for GBV victims to speak up by addressing cultural norms that are constructed by the patriarchal system  contributing to gender stereotypes , and ensuring that the essential services for GBV survivors are available and accessible.\n\nDistinguished guests,\n\nI am so happy to see that many people gather today in this beautiful park to dance together to make changes on this issue. Let's dance to make a real contribution to ending violence against women and girls in Viet Nam.\n\nEnding violence against women should be a priority for every man and woman.  Together, we can make Viet Nam safer and more equitable for women and girls.\n\nMay I wish you a fruitful and enjoyable event."}]}

At the outset, I am pleased to convey the UN Country Team’s sincere appreciation to the Government of Viet Nam for the unwavering commitment to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\n\nI would like to congratulate the Ministry of Planning and Investment (MPI) and other partners who have contributed to the preparation of the VNR report and in the organization of this important consultation on the draft report.\n\nThe VNR process is an excellent opportunity to take stock of the progress and discuss challenges for the implementation of the 2030 Agenda in Viet Nam. It is a platform to also help us identify emerging issues that need to be collectively addressed, and seize opportunities to accelerate progress towards achieving the SDGs. As often emphasized, the VNR is not an end, but it is a means to embody a whole-of-society approach in the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\n\nAs we review the second draft of the VNR report, I would like to share our global experience in term of what constitutes a good VNR report. These are analytical, inclusive, and evidence-informed. To this effect, I commend the Government of Viet Nam for utilizing innovative sources of data, drawing on in-depth analysis, and convening diverse stakeholder engagement.\n\nIn this effort, the UN is pleased to have provided specific technical inputs and data, including the tracking and assessment of the SDG progress and an analysis of who might be possibly left behind in Viet Nam’s sustainable development journey. We will continue to support policy dialogues on priority SDGs investments and much-needed communications and advocacy to sustain attention on these key priorities.\n\nDistinguished guests,\n\nSince the launch of Viet Nam’s National Action Plan for the Implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, Viet Nam has made considerable progress across various goals. Based on the National SDG Progress Assessment conducted jointly by the UN-ESCAP-MPI, Viet Nam has made substantial strides in Goal 1 – eradicating poverty; Goal 6 – providing clean water and sanitation; Goal 9 – developing industry, innovation and infrastructure; and Goal 10 – reducing inequalities. If the current pace of the progress is maintained throughout the remaining period, Viet Nam will be on track to achieve most of the targets under these goals.\n\nHowever, our analysis to date shows that goals 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 11, 12, and 14 risk themselves of falling short of the targets in Viet Nam. Also, we must watch out for some goals such as Goal 7 – access to affordable and clean energy; and Goal 15 – improving life on land as the achievements that Viet Nam has made over the decades may start to be reversed. Moreover, for some goals such as Goals 13, 16 and 17, we do not seem to have sufficient data to monitor and assess the progress.\n\nTherefore, as the UN system in Viet Nam, we think it is pivotal that solid, immediate and additional investments are required for Viet Nam on the following:\n\n1. expanding universal healthcare, quality education, and social protection;\n\n2. reducing inequalities further;\n\n3. mitigating climate change impacts and environmental degradation;\n\n4. promoting green energy and energy efficiency;\n\n5. mobilizing development finance; and\n\n6. meeting the data gap for nearly 40% of all SDG indicators.\n\nHere, let me point out that investment just in social protection and energy transition alone can accelerate the SDGs progress. The UN estimates that every Vietnamese Dong invested in social protection can generate more than one Vietnamese Dong in GDP, assuring greater socio-economic returns, contributing to achieving sustainable and inclusive growth, and leaving no one behind through the creation of job opportunities, protection of people’s livelihoods, improved access to social services, and enhanced business performance.\n\nDistinguished guests,\n\nThe UN is very much encouraged by the commitment of the Vietnamese Government through the Ministry of Planning and Investment in terms of going well beyond the production of the VNR report, and developing and implementing the follow-up actions to accelerate the achievement of SDGs. The UN stands ready to provide technical and financial support to the Government for SDGs achievements by 2030.\n\nWe have only 7 years left towards 2030. We must not spare any time but roll up our sleeves together to make sure that Viet Nam’s progress towards achieving SDGs is accelerated; Viet Nam’s socio-economic strategy and plan are fully implemented; and Viet Nam is spearheading with its sustainable development objectives in coming years.\n\nThank you! Xin cam on!"}]}

A very special welcome to all the young people here, who are a part of the 28 million adolescents and young people in Viet Nam.\n\nThis event is a demonstration of the United Nations' commitment to empower young people, especially in a country like Viet Nam, where a third of the population are adolescents and youth below the age of 29.\n\nIn Viet Nam, like in the world at large, the current generation of youth is the largest in history.\n\nThe objective of this years' International Youth Day, which is jointly organized by the Ha Giang Provincial Peoples' Committee and the Viet Nam Youth Union and the UN, is to work on the theme of \"Transforming Education\", looking at global and national efforts to make education more relevant, equitable and inclusive for all youth, especially those experiences that are co-designed and co-implemented by youth.\n\nDear friends,\n\nI am very happy to be here with you today in Ha Giang province, where a rich and diverse cultural heritage gives rise to great opportunities and challenges to the educational system. We would like to listen to your perspectives on transforming education, and your ideas your on how education could be adapted to build the kind of lives and livelihoods you would like to see for yourselves in the future.\n\nRooted in Goal 4 of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development – to \"ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all\", International Youth Day 2019 will also examine how Governments, young people and youth-led and youth-focused organizations, are transforming education so that it becomes a powerful tool to achieve the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\n\nViet Nam is experiencing a period of golden population bonus, recording the highest proportion of young people in the country's history. This period presents Viet Nam with a timely and unique opportunity to plan for a transformation and make its next generation of leaders and advocates the drivers of social, environmental and economic progress.\n\nDear friends,\n\nThis event is a great opportunity for young people to raise their voice and contribute their ideas. The main purpose of your participation is to empower you as individuals and as members of society to fulfill your role to improve the design and implementation of education policies, programmes and investments for young people.\n\nI would like to congratulate the Government of Viet Nam on their considerable efforts in improving the participation of adolescents and youth in the development of youth-related policies and frameworks.\n\nThe United Nations will continue to support these efforts, and to work with youth and their organizations with the aim of increasing the participation of young people in developing, implementing and monitoring the policies that affect their lives, such as the important work we have undertaken with the Ministry of Home Affairs in regard to the revision of the Youth Law.\n\nYouth need to be given the space to develop expertise and leadership and be taken on as partners in making of laws and policies that concern them at global, national and local levels.\n\nTomorrow, 12 August, will be the International Youth Day and the United Nations Population Fund will launch its new corporate strategy for adolescents and youth \"My Body, My Life, My World!\". The strategy underscores the centrality of young people to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals, alignments with the UN Strategy on Youth 2030 launched last year.\n\nActive, knowledgeable and innovative young people will be essential to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals and make good on our pledge to leave no one behind.\n\nToday is your day. Enjoy and have a great celebration!\n\nXin cám ơn !"}]}

The Global Transforming Education Summit is a key priority of the United Nations Secretary General, Mr António Guterres. Therefore, I take this opportunity, first and foremost, to thank MOET Viet Nam for organizing this national consultation. I thank all those participating in person and virtually for your commitment to transforming education.\n\nWe come together today at the behest of the UN Secretary-General, to shine a light on crucial steps needed by education systems in every country. Our goal in this national consultation is to identify concrete recommendations that will be carried to the Global Transforming Education Summit in September. Today, we are asked to address key challenges faced by education systems all over the world, allow to me raise four of these challenges:\n\nThese are the challenges set out by the Secretary-General in his call for the global summit. The urgency of the call recognizes that the world faces a learning crisis. A crisis that pre-dated the pandemic in some countries; but which has seen the numbers of children being left behind increase exponentially as the pandemic unfolded.\n\nThe call to action by the Secretary-General – signals that business as usual is not an option. The learning of children and young people has been devasted by the pandemic. Teachers have been lost from the system. Child labour numbers have increased as children lost their faith in education to change their lives. Children who remain in the system face years of lost learning, their confidence, social skills, mental health are all negatively affected.  I encourage us all to make space, to hear the voices of those most affected - the children and young people themselves. As a part of this national consultation and the Global Summit, the United Nations is consulting young people, listening to their experiences as well as the solutions that they want to contribute; recognizing them as important partners at the table in the transformation of education.\n\nDistinguished guests,\n\nDespite all the evidence of impact, all the arguments regarding the risk to economic growth in the future, when the pandemic recovery plans of countries are analysed – education is rarely mentioned. On average, when an investment in education was made, countries allocated only 3 per cent of their COVID-19 stimulus package to education. This is compounded by the decline in the ODA and humanitarian aid for education since the beginning of the pandemic. Without this investment the achievement of SDG 4 is in grave doubt.\n\nThe catalytic effect of achieving SDG4 cannot be overestimated, as all SDGs rely on education. The cost of not investing in education reform is catastrophic. Globally, lifelong lost earnings due to learning poverty could top $17 trillion by 2030.  Yet evidence suggests that as little as $10 to $15 per child is enough to deliver remedial education and strengthen existing education systems’ ability to deliver on foundational skills. This $10 to $15 can cover support, training, and incentives for teachers, as well as additional materials and resources.  Financing foundation skills is a short-term investment.The cost of inaction, however, is a lifelong loss.\n\nGrounded in a commitment to the principle of “No one left behind”, Viet Nam has invested about 20% of its national budget expenditure in the education sector. The challenge as we all know, is that while that sounds like a strong investment – most goes to teacher salaries – there is little space for the kinds of school renewal and reform that the transformation agenda asks of them.\n\nExcellency, Ladies and Gentlemen,\n\nAs a result of COVID here in Viet Nam, lessons abound regarding the use of technology and distance learning solutions to ensure the continuity of learning, and to support the learning of children with a disability, or those left behind when the language of instruction differs from that spoken at home. We saw evidence of a far greater digital divide than was recognised, where both teachers and children were left behind. We appreciated that insufficient schools are healthy and safe spaces with too many lacking the facilities for children to wash their hands, to use clean toilets. We have also seen in a recent UNICEF-supported study – that there has been a significant increase in the number of upper secondary children facing mental health challenges.  Each of these areas requires urgent attention, each justifies an investment. We must join hands and advocate with the Ministry of Finance for expanding investments in the education system.\n\nA part of the transformational agenda focuses oncurriculum-- introducing social-emotional learning and skills, transferable skills or twenty-first-century skills as they are often called, as well as digital literacy and skills. But it is also a question of changed teaching approaches, re-skilled teachers with new teaching methodologies, ending didactic / memory-based teaching methodologies and creating far more participatory, problem-based learning; drawing on blended education where digital tools aid learning for every child.\n\nThe good news here in Viet Nam is that – even prior to COVID – MOET had started to work on the curriculum for the foundational skills, introducing new approaches to learning. Recognising the important role of the private sector, several local and international companies have been engaged in advising and co-creating new approaches.  This work, including the teacher training, is still in the early stages – investment is needed to advance this, to accelerate the necessary changes.\n\nAnother element in the transformational agenda is the learning-losscatch-upandequitable access to quality education.\n\nData from the General Statistics Office (GSO) 2020-2021 SDG Indicators on Children and Women Survey not only confirmed the digital divide, exposed so visibly over the past two years of battling COVID-19, but it shows us the hurdles that must be addressed if the Government’s vision of a digital transformation is to be realized. While a relatively high level of internet coverage at a low cost is found, the survey shows that nationwide, the majority of girls and boys – men and women - do not have good ICT skills, and not surprisingly, the divide widens between ethnic groups, rural and urban areas, and the richest and poorest segments of the population.\n\nThe survey also highlighted worrying trends including a gender disparity – where a mere 51.4% of boys complete upper secondary, compared with 65% of girls. No country can afford to lose nearly 50% of either gender from their ongoing education system. Boys lured by the promise of a dollar today – are choosing instead poverty for life.  As UNESCO makes clear - this makes it much harder for children to acquire the technical and higher-order skills needed to thrive in increasingly demanding labor markets, and for countries to develop the human capital needed for sustained, inclusive economic growth. As machines replace low wage positions – the prospects are dire for economic growth in the future.\n\nDear Excellencies, colleagues, distinguished guests,\n\nWith the SDG goal in mind, to ensure that all children complete equitable and quality education, an education that leads to relevant and effective learning outcomes by 2030, it is time for a revamp. We need to prioritize the issues in the education sector that will help Viet Nam achieve the education-related SDG targets: issues such as inequity in access, learning loss, digital divide, gender gaps, education financing gaps, and specific needs of education for particular groups of children / young people.\n\nToday, I encourage you to identify innovative approaches that can serve as levers for game-changing transformations of education policy and practice in the medium and longer term. And I appeal to each of you to commit to supporting the MOET to make the investment case to the Government / to the Ministry of Finance to increase the investment in schools and to vocational training centres.\n\nAs a newly arrived UN Resident Coordinator, it is symbolic that my first public speech is on transforming education. This represents my commitment to SDG 4 and the young people of Vietnam.\n\nI close by once again congratulating the Government of Viet Nam. I thank MOET for taking the lead to organize this national consultation on Transforming Education. I thank you also for your patience with my lengthy remarks.\n\nWe encourage the Government to hold further consultations and, most importantly, to ensure that commitments are turned into action, with an investment to reform.\n\nWe look forward to the results of today’s consultation and reiterate the commitment of the United Nations agencies to support the Government in promoting transformative changes in education, with the hope and belief to increase Viet Nam’s ability to achieve the Sustainable Development Goal 4 (SDG4) by 2030 in an inclusive manner, Leaving No One Behind.\n\nThank you. Xin Cam On."}]}

China – a leader in the energy transition – 20%.\n\nAnd in the European Union, nearly 33%.\n\nAnd clean energy sector jobs now outnumber fossil fuel jobs – employing almost 35 million people worldwide.\n\nEven Texas – the heart of the American fossil fuel industry – now leads the US in renewables.\n\nWhy?  Because it makes economic sense.\n\nAnd yet fossil fuels still enjoy a 9 to 1 advantage in consumption subsidies globally – a clear market distortion.\n\nAdd to that the unaccounted costs of climate damages on people and planet – and the distortion is even greater.\n\nCountries that cling to fossil fuels are not protecting their economies – they are sabotaging them.\n\nDriving up costs.\n\nUndermining competitiveness.\n\nLocking-in stranded assets.\n\nAnd missing the greatest economic opportunity of the 21st century.\n\nDear friends,\n\nSecond -- renewables are here to stay because they are the foundation of energy security and sovereignty.\n\nLet’s be clear:  The greatest threat to energy security today is fossil fuels.\n\nThey leave economies and people at the mercy of price shocks, supply disruptions, and geopolitical turmoil.\n\nJust look at Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nA war in Europe led to a global energy crisis.\n\nOil and gas prices soared.\n\nElectricity and food bills followed.\n\nIn 2022 average households around the world saw energy costs jump 20%.\n\nModern and competitive economies need stable, affordable energy.  Renewables offer both.\n\nThere are no price spikes for sunlight.\n\nNo embargoes on wind.\n\nRenewables can put power – literally and figuratively – in the hands of people and governments.\n\nAnd almost every nation has enough sun, wind, or water to become energy self-sufficient.\n\nRenewables mean real energy security.  Real energy sovereignty. And real freedom from fossil-fuel volatility.\n\nDear friends,\n\nYou can’t build a coal plant in someone’s backyard.\n\nThe third and final reason why there is no going back on renewables:  Easy access.\n\nBut you can deliver solar panels to the most remote village on earth.\n\nSolar and wind can be deployed faster, cheaper and more flexibly than fossil fuels ever could.\n\nAnd while nuclear will be part of the global energy mix, it can never fill the access gaps.\n\nAll of this is a game-changer for the hundreds of millions of people still living without electricity – most of them in Africa, a continent bursting with renewable potential.\n\nBy 2040, Africa could generate 10 times more electricity than it needs – entirely from renewables.\n\nWe are already seeing small-scale and off-grid renewable technologies lighting homes, and powering schools and businesses.\n\nAnd in places like Pakistan, people-power is fueling a solar surge – consumers are driving the clean energy boom.\n\nDear friends,\n\nThe energy transition is unstoppable.\n\nBut the transition is not yet fast enough or fair enough.\n\nOECD countries and China account for 80% of renewable power capacity installed worldwide.\n\nBrazil and India make up nearly 10%.\n\nAfrica -- just 1.5%.  Meanwhile, the climate crisis is laying waste to lives and livelihoods.\n\nClimate disasters in small island states have wiped out over 100% of GDP.\n\nIn the United States, they are pushing insurance premiums through the roof.\n\nAnd the 1.5 degree limit is in unprecedented peril.\n\nTo keep it within reach, we must drastically speed up the reduction of emissions – and the reach of the clean energy transition.\n\nWith manufacturing capacity racing, prices plummeting, and COP30 fast approaching…\n\nThis is our moment of opportunity.\n\nWe must seize it.\n\nWe can do so by taking action in six opportunity areas.\n\nFirst – by using new national climate plans to go all-out on the energy transition.\n\nToo often, governments send mixed messages:\n\nBold renewable targets on one day.  New fossil fuel subsidies and expansions the next.\n\nThe next national climate plans, or NDCs, are due in a matter of months.\n\nThey must bring clarity and certainty.\n\nG20 countries must lead. They produce 80% of global emissions.\n\nThe principle of common but differentiated responsibilities must apply but every country must do more.\n\nAhead of COP30 in Brazil this November, they must submit new plans.\n\nI invite leaders to present their new NDCs at an event I will host in September, during General Assembly High-level week. These must:\n\nCover all emissions, across the entire economy.\n\nAlign with the 1.5 degree limit.\n\nIntegrate energy, climate and sustainable development priorities into one coherent vision.\n\nAnd deliver on global promises:\n\nTo double energy efficiency and triple renewables capacity by 2030.\n\nAnd to accelerate the transition away from fossil fuels.\n\nThese plans must be backed by long-term roadmaps for a just transition to net-zero energy systems – in line with global net-zero by 2050.\n\nAnd they must be underpinned by policies that show that the clean energy future is not just inevitable – but investable.\n\nPolicies that create clear regulations and a pipeline of projects.\n\nThat enhance public-private partnerships – unlocking capital and innovation.\n\nThat put a meaningful price on carbon.\n\nAnd that end subsidies and international public finance for fossil fuels – as promised.\n\nSecond, this is our moment of opportunity to build the energy systems of the 21st century.\n\nThe technology is moving ahead.\n\nIn just fifteen years, the cost of battery storage systems for electricity grids has dropped over 90%.\n\nBut here’s the problem.\n\nInvestments in the right infrastructure are not keeping up.\n\nFor every dollar invested in renewable power, just 60 cents go to grids and storage.\n\nThat ratio should be one-to-one.\n\nWe are building renewable power – but not connecting it fast enough.\n\nThere’s three times more renewable energy waiting to be plugged into grids than was added last year.\n\nAnd fossil fuels still dominate the global total energy mix.\n\nWe must act now and invest in the backbone of a clean energy future:\n\nIn modern, flexible and digital grids – including regional integration.\n\nIn a massive scale-up of energy storage.\n\nIn charging networks – to power the electric vehicle revolution.\n\nAnd in energy efficiency and electrification -- across buildings, transport and industry.\n\nThis is how we unlock the full promise of renewables – and build energy systems that are clean, secure and fit for the future.\n\nThird, this is our moment of opportunity to meet the world’s surging energy demand sustainably.\n\nMore people are plugging in.\n\nMore cities are heating up – with soaring demand for cooling.\n\nAnd more technologies – from AI to digital finance – are devouring electricity.\n\nGovernments must aim to meet all new electricity demand with renewables.\n\nAI can boost efficiency, innovation, and resilience in energy systems.\n\nBut it is also energy-hungry.\n\nThe largest ones will soon use twenty times that.\n\nA typical AI data-center eats-up as much electricity as 100,000 homes.\n\nBy 2030, data centres could consume as much electricity as all of Japan does today.\n\nThis is not sustainable – unless we make it so.\n\nAnd the technology sector must be out front.\n\nToday I call on every major tech firm to power all data centres with 100% renewables by 2030.\n\nAnd – along with other industries – they must use water sustainably in cooling systems.\n\nThe future is being built in the cloud.\n\nIt must be powered by the sun, the wind, and the promise of a better world.\n\nDear friends,\n\nFourth, this is the moment of opportunity for a just energy transition.\n\nThe clean energy era must deliver equity, dignity and opportunity for all.\n\nThat means governments leading a just transition.\n\nWith support, education and training – for fossil fuel workers, young people, women, Indigenous Peoples and others – so that they can thrive in the new energy economy.\n\nWith stronger social protection – so no one is left behind.\n\nAnd with international cooperation to help low-income countries that are highly dependent on fossil fuels and struggling to make the shift.\n\nBut justice doesn’t stop there.\n\nAnd today, we see history repeating.\n\nCommunities mistreated.\n\nRights trampled.\n\nThe critical minerals that power the clean energy revolution are often found in countries that have long been exploited.\n\nEnvironments trashed.\n\nNations stuck at the bottom of value chains – while others reap rewards.\n\nAnd extractive models digging deeper holes of inequality and harm.\n\nThis must end.\n\nDeveloping countries can play a major role in diversifying sources of supply.\n\nThe UN Panel on Critical Energy Transition Minerals has shown the way forward – with a path grounded in human rights, justice and equity.\n\nToday, I call on governments, businesses and civil society to work with us to deliver its recommendations.\n\nLet’s build a future that is not only green – but just.\n\nNot only fast – but fair.\n\nNot only transformative – but inclusive.\n\nFifth, we have a moment of opportunity to use trade and investment to supercharge the energy transition.\n\nClean energy needs more than ambition.\n\nIt needs access – to technologies, materials, and manufacturing.\n\nBut these are concentrated in just a few countries.\n\nAnd global trade is fragmenting.\n\nTrade policy must support climate policy.\n\nCountries committed to the new energy era must come together to ensure that trade and investment drive it forward.\n\nBy building diverse, secure, and resilient supply chains.\n\nBy cutting tariffs on clean energy goods.\n\nBy unlocking investment and trade – including through South-South cooperation.\n\nAnd by modernizing outdated investment treaties – starting with Investor-State\n\nDispute Settlement provisions.\n\nToday, fossil fuel interests are weaponizing these provisions to delay the transition, particularly in developing countries.\n\nReform is urgent.\n\nThe race for the new must not be a race for the few.\n\nIt must be a relay – shared, inclusive and resilient.\n\nLet’s make trade a tool for transformation.\n\nSixth and finally, this is our moment of opportunity to unleash the full force of finance – driving investment to markets with massive potential.\n\nDespite soaring demand and vast renewables potential -- developing countries are being locked out of the energy transition.\n\nAfrica is home to 60% of the world’s best solar resources.  But it received just 2% of global clean energy investment last year.\n\nZoom out, and the picture is just as stark.\n\nIn the last decade, only one in every five clean energy dollars went to emerging and developing countries outside China.\n\nTo keep the 1.5 degree limit alive -- and deliver universal energy access – annual clean energy investment in those countries must rise more than fivefold by 2030.\n\nThat demands bold national policies.  And concrete international action to:\n\nReform the global financial architecture.\n\nDrastically increase the lending capacity of multilateral development banks -- making them bigger, bolder, and better able to leverage massive amounts of private finance at reasonable costs;\n\nAnd take effective action on debt relief – and scale up proven tools like debt for climate swaps.\n\nToday, developing countries pay outlandish sums for both debt and equity financing – in part because of outdated risk models, bias and broken assumptions that boost the cost of capital.\n\nCredit ratings agencies and investors must modernize.\n\nWe need a new approach to risk that reflects:\n\nThe promise of clean energy.\n\nThe rising cost of climate chaos.\n\nAnd the danger of stranded fossil fuel assets.\n\nI urge parties to unite to solve the complex challenges facing some developing countries in the energy transition – such as early retirement of coal plants.\n\nDear friends,\n\nThe fossil fuel age is flailing and failing.\n\nWe are in the dawn of a new energy era.\n\nWhere nations have the security of energy autonomy.\n\nAnd the gift of power is a gift for all.\n\nThat world is within reach.\n\nAn era where cheap, clean, abundant energy powers a world rich in economic opportunity.\n\nBut it won’t happen on its own.\n\nNot fast enough.\n\nNot fair enough.\n\nIt is up to us.\n\nWe have the tools to power the future for humanity.\n\nLet’s make the most of them.\n\nThis is our moment of opportunity.\n\nThank you."}]}

This event is commendable as we join communities around the Planet as they celebrated World Environment Day on 5 June and World Oceans Day on 8 June.\n\nExcellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,\n\nAs you know, plastic waste is now a major source of pollutionaffecting the environment, human health and well-being. It is also a major threat to coastal nations currently enjoying the economic benefits from fishing and aqua-culture. Strong attention has been paid to plastic pollution not only globally but also in Viet Nam.\n\nToday, we produce about 300 million tonnes of plastic waste every year. That’s nearly equivalent to the weight of the entire human population. In the next 10-15 years, global plastic production is projected to nearly double. Production is scheduled to reach 500 million tonnes by 2025 and a staggering 619 million tonnes by 2030.\n\nIn Viet Nam, it is estimated that 1.8 million tons of plastic waste are generated every year with plastic consumption increasing 16-18 per cent annually. Viet Nam is listed among the top 5 countries responsible for the estimated 13 million tons of plastic dumped in our oceans every year. Single-use plastics are everywhere and waste management capacity is limited in Viet Nam, leading to greater impacts from plastic waste on the environment and public health.\n\nMeanwhile waste management, recycling facilities and relevant policies that facilitate them, are not in place to sufficiently respond to the increasing needs. One major concern on this issue is the lack of a system for waste segregation at source.\n\nExcellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,\n\nUnder the Government’s leadership led by Your Excellency Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc, we are seeing increasing political momentum in combating Plastic Waste in many coastal provinces, as well as in the business sector.\n\nThe event today, together with many which happened this week across the country, have been good illustrations of collective actions by all of us to combat one of the great environmental challenges of our time - such collective action is needed from governments, the private sector, as well as individuals in their roles both as citizens and purchasers of products.\n\nGovernmentsmust lead by enacting strong policies to shift from the use of unnecessary single-use plastics to sustainable circular models of design and production, so that plastics can be used as a renewable resource rather than disposable waste. Robust legislation must be enacted to curb the production and use of unnecessary single-use plastics.\n\nThe private sectormust innovate, adopting business models that reduce the downstream impacts of their products. Manufacturers must take responsibility for the pollution that their products are causing today and make investments in sustainable product design.\n\nCitizensmust act as both consumers and informed citizens to demand sustainable products, adopt sensible consumption habits and exercise their buying power by refusing single-use plastics.\n\nCombating plastic pollution is crucial to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), to which we all are committed. We encourage the Government of Viet Nam to promote a holistic circular economy approach and to adopt strong policies to address plastic waste pollution, promote sustainable and responsible business for resource-efficient and cleaner production, and ensure the design of products without pollutants.\n\nThe UN is committed to working side-by-side with the Government of Viet Nam, its public institutions, the private sector and local communities to reduce plastic pollution through technical assistance, policy advice and capacity building. Working together, we have forged strong partnerships to address this and many other environmental challenges.\n\nIt is heartening to see increased awareness and political momentum to reduce the impacts of plastics use. I commend the recent efforts taking place in Viet Nam to reduce the impacts of plastic pollution, including the environment campaigns ranging from Quang Ninh to Bac Lieu Provinces and the Business Forum recently held in Ho Chi Minh City. I also hope that the energy and enthusiasm we witness today can serve as a catalyst for lasting change in our thinking, our policies and our behaviour towards the use of plastic! Together we can build a cleaner, healthier, prosperous Viet Nam.\n\nI wish you all good health, happiness, and sustainability!\n\nThank you! Xin cảm ơn!"}]}

In the very same year, in 1945, President Ho Chi Minh read the Declaration of Independence of Viet Nam at Ba Dinh Square, not too far from here, with a similar aspiration to build a peaceful, united and strong country.\n\nMarking this meaningful milestone, the United Nations which has “We the Peoples” as the first three words of its Charter which was agreed in San Francisco in 1945, has turned to the “people” throughout its history, and especially during the past 10 months of reflection during its 75th Anniversary since January this year. As the title of this photo contest indicates, we have set our goals and targets for this year as listening to what people want – especially, “the future people want”.\n\nWe have organized several activities to hear from young people, journalists and reporters, government counterparts as well as the international community and photographers to understand “the future they want” and to ask them to identify the role of the UN in realizing that future.\n\nToday, the UN in Viet Nam invites you to view 49 impressive photographs exhibited around the halls of Viet Nam Women’s Museum. These carefully selected photographs both depict images of a desirable future such as those of healthy old couples, hard-working workers and students, happy families, preservation of culture, but also the challenges we are faced with including those related to climate change, gender equality, education gaps and health risks such as COVID-19.\n\nThese challenges are not only unique to Viet Nam. Many neighboring countries are situated in similar or even worse situations. In September, the UN General Assembly was organized amid COVID-19 and the UN launched its UN75 Report based on the responses collected from 1 million people around the world. While respondents unsurprisingly at this time identified health as the most pressing issue, 87% of respondents believe international cooperation is vital to deal with today’s challenges and that the COVID-19 crisis has made international cooperation even more urgent.\n\nThe United Nations symbolizes the power of solidarity to overcome global challenges. We need to come together, hand in hand, in partnerships through multilateral, international discussion and cooperation. Only when we come together, can we tackle the challenges and convert the high aspirations of the UN Charter into reality for the future we want.\n\nI would like to congratulate the 4 winners who will be announced today on their achievements. I would also like to thank the members of the judging panel including Ms Elisa Fernandez Saenz, Vice-Chair of the UN Communications Group and the Representative of UN Women in Viet Nam, whose organization has greatly contributed to the success of the UN75 Photo Contest; His Excellency Mr. Giorgio Aliberti, the EU Ambassador to Viet Nam, Mr. Do Hung Viet, Director-General of the Department of International Organizations of Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ms. Nguyen Hai Van, Director of Viet Nam Women’s Museum, Mr. Nguyen Viet Thanh, a professional Photojournalist of Vietnam News Agency, and Ms. Dao Ngoc Phuong Linh, National Coordinator of 2030 Youth Force Viet Nam representing the youth of the country for their important roles in this event and for sharing their frank opinions during the Final Judging Round in which they participated together with me.\n\nI also very much appreciate Viet Nam Women’s Museum’s contribution to this photo exhibition by providing the venue for this event and for the open exhibition they are hosting for us. Given our venue and the fact that we are less than a week away from another special occasion, allow me to also extend my congratulations on the 90th anniversary of the founding of Viet Nam Women’s Union on 20 October, 1930.\n\nI hope the UN75 Photo Exhibition and today’s Award Ceremony will inspire you to seriously reflect on the future you want and what the UN’s and each of our roles should be to realize such a future.\n\nThank you for coming today and I wish you all health, success and happiness!Thank you.

The UPR mechanism is a vital process within the realm of human rights, providing an avenue for countries to be reviewed by their peers and to assess their progress in promoting and protecting human rights.\n\nToday, our objective is threefold:\n\nFirst, to increase awareness and knowledge about the UPR mechanism and the role of non-state actors during the process,\n\nSecond, to amplify the participation and engagement of non-state actors in the UPR process, and\n\nThird, to equip non-state actors with the necessary skills to effectively contribute to the UPR stakeholders' submissions.\n\nAs the UN in Viet Nam, we have a collective responsibility to enhance understanding about the UPR mechanism and the valuable role non-state actors play within it. Your  contributions are integral to a comprehensive and inclusive review. This information session will provide insights into key aspects such as drafting high-quality submissions, conducting effective research, and engaging with relevant stakeholders. An important focus of drafting the report is in providing evidence-based information, supported by credible sources. By doing so, we strengthen the credibility and impact of our collective advocacy efforts.\n\nThe UPR process is not merely a review mechanism. It presents an opportunity to drive positive change and promote human rights at the national level. By actively engaging in the drafting of the report, you are contributing to a broader dialogue and shaping the future of human rights.\n\nOur hope is that as many diverse voices are heard and considered in this process.\n\nOur efforts today aim to contribute enhancing implementation of human rights standards and fostering meaningful progress in fulfilling human rights for all.\n\nI take this opportunity to express my sincerest gratitude to UNDP and VUFO for their support in organizing this important and timely information session, and for creating a safe space for collaboration.\n\nThank you!

I congratulate the Government of Vietnam, especially MPI as the lead agency on SDGs, on the successful presentation of Viet Nam's first Voluntary National Report (VNR) at the recent High-Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF) in New York in July.\n\nThe UN in Viet Nam is proud to have been a key partner contributing to this success. Our Resident Coordinator, Mr. Kamal Malhotra, accompanied the Vietnamese delegation at the HLPF and extended his full support to Viet Nam's delivery of the VNR presentation.\n\nViet Nam's VNR report covers all 17 SDGs and is one of the most comprehensive reviews globally. Being closely involved in the development process, we are pleased to see the Viet Nam VNR upholds three key principles of a VNR report:\n\nLadies and Gentlemen,\n\nThe VNR is an important milestone within the SDG National Action Plan, demonstrating the Gov's continuous and strong commitment in SDG implementation, monitoring and reporting.\n\nMoving forward, we would like to highlight the following suggestions:\n\nFirst, stakeholder engagement is crucial and can be further strengthened:As we are aware, the 2030 Agenda has ambitious targets, covering multiple and interconnected sectors, and requires contributions from all government bodies and all parts of the society. There is still a lot more potential from the private sector and CSOs, thus their participation should be encouraged and institutionalized, using meaningful and innovative mechanisms. Further engagement with the National Assembly, sub-national authorities and people-selected bodies, youth (as a positive agent for change), and grass-root communities, particularly most vulnerable and disadvantaged people also need to be enhanced to ensure leaving no one behind.\n\nSecond, it is critical to have continued high level government leadership to improve inter sectoral government coordination. We encourage the Government to go beyond silo and \"business as usual\" approach and strengthen the inter-sectoral coordination. We are also glad to hear that last week the VCCI chairman was delegated to be the vice chairman of the National Council for Sustainable Development and Enhancement of Competitiveness, as well as a new committee on public-private partnership (PPP) was established under this National Council.\n\nThird, it's crucial to have the SDGs/VSDGs targets and indicators mainstreamed into the next 5-year Socio-Economic Development Plan (SEDP) and 10-year Socio-Economic Development Strategy (SEDS):This is to ensure the alignment between the SDG global agenda with the national development agenda. To our knowledge, the SEDS drafting process has just been initiated. We strongly suggest the process use the SDG-integrated and participatory approaches from the beginning. The UN is happy to be positively engaged with the process.\n\nFinally, the availability of credible data is critically important to monitor progress, and for the UN to pay special attention.According to GSO's review, the current statistical capacity meets less than one third of the SDG data need. In order to have effective reporting, more effort and investment on data are needed. We suggest the Government to be bold and innovative in mobilizing data from different reliable sources, applying innovative and new methods and technologies for effective data collections such as real time monitoring and big data. It will be useful to create an integrated platform to encourage partnership for SDG data.\n\nSDGs stay at the centre of our support to the country. The UN in Viet Nam is committed to supporting Vietnam in this long and rewarding development journey to achieve the 2030 Agenda.\n\nWe look forward to continued cooperation with the government, development partners, CSOs, private sector, and all other stakeholders to advance the 2030 Agenda forward and leave no one behind.\n\nI wish you all good health and a productive workshop.

It is estimated that some plastic products retain their original recognizable form 400 years after discharge into the ocean.\n\nThese are the world of statistics, but what do those numbers look like in Viet Nam? How many plastic bags are we using each day? How many plastic bags are we throwing away? According to recent studies, Viet Nam is among the top five countries globally contributing as much as 60 percent of all plastic waste that enters the world's seas.\n\nIt is encouraging that 25 embassies, together with the UN Country Team and other international organisations working in Viet Nam have come together and discussed with Government ministries and Ha Noi city about potential Government policy reform on the use of plastics. The international partners also signed a joint Code of Conduct on plastic waste pollution, further highlighting our commitment to take concrete actions on single-use plastic and our current plastic waste footprint.\n\nThe UN in Viet Nam has been working closely with the Government and the Vietnamese people to promote a greener sustainable lifestyle and consumption habits. The UN supports the Government of Viet Nam in adopting and regularly updating key related policies, including the Law on Environmental Protection, and the Green Growth and environment strategies and plans. Furthermore, the UN promotes important initiatives such as eco-industrial park, green chemistry or chemical product life-cycle management, and green industry toward sustainable production and industrialization.\n\nAs an example, the UN, together with the Swedish Embassy, launched a 7-day challenge to encourage people to eat, live and move smartly and sustainably. At the UN, we have ended using plastic bottles for meetings in the UN building and provided incubation for \"Save our Oceans\" – a youth start up that have designed pay-as-you-go water refill stations, using near field communication (NFC) sticker technology, to reduce the use of plastic bottles.\n\nDistinguished guests,\n\nMoving forward, we need more effective and faster local actions, while ensuring a more coherent regional and global approach to improve environmentally effective management of the full-life-cycle of plastic. On this occasion, I would like to note the following three actions on how we can make a difference.\n\nFirst, there is a need to recreate or revitalize a market of environmentally-friendly traditional alternatives that are locally and readily available. In the past, the Vietnamese people used banana and lotus leaves to cover their food and used fabric bags for shopping. Effectively using those traditional and simple best practices, the Government should create a stronger legal framework and provide associated incentives for businesses and the private sector, who in turn can design and produce environmentally friendlier products.\n\nSecond, commitment and actions by each individual citizen are required. Collective actions by citizens are the most powerful force to shape and drive the evolving market of environmentally-friendly products. Let us start by reducing and stopping the usage of plastic bags and plastic bottles immediately and use locally made fabric bags.\n\nThird, a global or regional approach to better mitigate pollution from plastic waste is required for the full integrated life cycle. In association with this, the Government of Viet Nam should initiate and lead a regional joint programme among the five countries which are significantly contributing plastic waste that is released into our oceans.\n\nLadies and gentlemen,\n\nI would like to congratulate the Government of Viet Nam for hosting this year's Global Assembly of the Global Environment Facility in June in Da Nang, where marine litter and the non-sustainable use of plastic is a key topic. Held every four years, the GEF Assembly will bring together one thousand delegates, including Government leaders, UN agencies, civil society organizations and business leaders, from more than 180 countries to discuss and share experiences, best practices and solutions needed to protect the global environment. It will be an excellent opportunity for the Government of Viet Nam to successfully facilitate dialogues and identify actions to \"beat plastic pollution\" to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\n\nAllow me to conclude with the words of the UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres on the occasion of World Environment Day: \"If present trends continue, by 2050 our oceans will have more plastic than fish. The message is simple: reject single-use plastic. Refuse what you can't re-use. Together, we can chart a path to a cleaner, greener world\".\n\nThe UN Country Team will continue its close cooperation with the Government and people of Viet Nam, as well as development partners and other key stakeholders, for strengthened sustainable development and environmental protection to ensure a more sustainable future for Viet Nam where no one left behind.\n\nWe hope the spirit of World Environment Day will make a change in thinking and behaviour towards the use of plastic!\n\nWe wish you all good health, happiness, and sustainability!\n\nXin Cam On!"}]}

María Jesús Figa   López-Palop, Ambassador of Spain\n\nExcellencies Ambassadors,\n\nLadies and gentlemen,\n\nIt is a pleasure for me to be here to celebrate the 110th Anniversary of International Women’s Day with you and to see so many people in the audience. Thank you for coming.\n\nThis year, on its 110th Anniversary, the theme for International Women’s Day is: “I Am Generation Equality: Realizing Women’s Rights”. The theme invites us to focus on accelerating efforts to advance gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls all over the world.\n\n2020 is a pivotal year for advancing gender equality worldwide. It marks 25 years since the adoption of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action– the most progressive blueprint for advancing women’s rights; it is also 20 years since UN Security Council Resolution 1325 on Women, Peace and Security; it is 5 years since the Sustainable Development Goals were agreed; 10 years since the creation of UN Women; and 75 years since the founding of the United Nations.\n\nIn Viet Nam, we have seen remarkable progress on women’s rights and leadership in some areas, notably on access to education and maternal health and in strengthening the legal and institutional framework for gender equality.\n\nBut in many areas, we are running just to stay on track: we face pushback and slow progress. Let me provide a few examples:\n\nNevertheless, Viet Nam has accomplished a lot and, overall, is doing quite well.\n\nLadies and gentlemen,\n\nSustainable Development Goal (SDG) 5 is a prerequisite for and the great enabler of sustainable development and the SDGs as a whole. Unless progress on gender equality is accelerated, the global community will not only fail to achieve SDG 5, it will also forgo the catalytic effect that gender equality can have for the achievement of all the 17 SDGs and the 2030 Agenda more broadly.\n\nA lot of work therefore remains to be done to tackle the unfulfilled promise of the Beijing Platform.\n\nUN Women, together with feminists across the world, and the Governments of Mexico and France, will convene the Generation Equality Forum in Mexico City from 7 to 8 May, and in Paris from 7 to 10 July 2020.\n\nThe Generation Equality Forum in Paris which will mark the 25th Anniversary of the Beijing Platform for Action will launch a set of six catalytic Action Coalitions to drive investment and produce tangible, irreversible results on gender equality. The six catalytic Action Coalitions include:\n\nAction Coalitions are global, innovative, multi-stakeholder partnerships that will mobilize governments, civil society, international organizations, and the private sector to catalyze collective action for game-changing results across generations for girls and women.\n\nWe hope that Viet Nam will be an active part of all these Generation Equality Coalitions both this year and in the years ahead.\n\nExcellencies, Ladies and gentlemen,\n\nAs the ASEAN Chair for 2020 and a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council for 2020-2021, Viet Nam has unique and synergistic opportunities to showcase its leading role in promoting gender equality in the region and the world this year.\n\nThe United Nations stands ready to continue to support the people and the government of Viet Nam in this important endeavour.\n\nXin Cam on! Thank you!"}]}

Since then, much has been achieved through this partnership and cooperation including; increased food security with a focus on the alleviation of hunger, addressing malnutrition and food safety concerns, sustainable development of the agricultural sector, rural development and sustainable poverty reduction and enhanced resilience of communities to disasters and threats.\n\nAnimal Health Information Systems connect disease information between farms, villages, communes, districts, provinces, central veterinary offices, the laboratory and other stakeholders. These systems play an important role in supporting surveillance activities, help with the analysis of animal disease events and facilitate responses to the control of animal diseases in Viet Nam. Currently, the government of Viet Nam's circulars and guidelines for reporting diseases require the reporting of diseases from grassroots to central level with standardized formats through both an immediate and monthly reporting system.\n\nTo support and improve legislative reporting requirements, FAO and the Department of Animal Health, with financial support from the United States Agency for International Development, has developed a national electronic animal disease reporting system called Viet Nam Animal Health Information System or VAHIS. This system has incorporated lessons learnt from previous database implementation attempts in Viet Nam, an assessment of the animal health information system in Viet Nam which was completed in 2014, and a consultation process between August – October 2016.\n\nWith the standardized format, VAHIS will effectively connect disease information from farms, villages, communes, districts, provinces, Regional Animal Health Offices and other relevant stakeholders. The system is expected to be a crucial instrument in executing and enforcing the government of Viet Nam's circulars and guidelines and ensuring the availability of accurate and timely data to the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development to support decision making.\n\nLadies and Gentlemen,\n\nWhile launching VAHIS is a very important milestone, it is of course not sufficient. VAHIS success can only be achieved with strong commitment and effective implementation of the circulars and guidance. The FAO in Viet Nam would like to call for continued commitment from the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, provincial Departments of Agriculture and Rural Development and sub-departments of Livestock and Animal Health to support VAHIS implementation nationwide. With your commitment and support, VAHIS will enable a quick response to disease outbreaks, minimize economic loss and build trust in Viet Nam's livestock products with both domestic and global consumers in the long run.\n\nI would like to thank our colleagues from the Department of Animal Health for their strong collaboration and USAID for their financial support in the development and implementation of VAHIS.\n\nI wish you all good health and look forward to your kind support in making the VAHIS system a success. This should help propel Viet Nam into the next phase of livestock industry development in the near future.\n\nThank you very much. Xin cảm ơn."}]}

Without MPI’s close collaboration with UN ESCAP and the UN in Viet Nam, we would not be here today to learn the results of the joint macroeconomic modelling exercise.\n\nDistinguished Participants, Colleagues,\n\nViet Nam has sustained high economic growth, improved living standards and reduced multidimensional poverty, despite setbacks during the COVID-19. With this record of success, Viet Nam has set a higher bar for its development journey: to becomea high-income country by 2045and to realizenet-zero emissions by 2050. This vision encompasses Viet Nam’s determination to realize the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030.\n\nAt the 79th session of the UN General Assembly and at the Summit of the Future in September, Party General Secretary, H.E. Mr. To Lam welcomed the adoption of thePact for the Future– the outcome document of the Summit that underlines the imperative of accelerating the achievement of SDGs along with promotion of peace and security; deploying science, digital technology and innovation for sustainable development; investing in youth and future generations, and transforming of global governance.\n\nAt the Summit, H.E. Party General Secretary To Lam also emphasized thathumans, people, must be placed at the centre of development policies and actions. This reinforces strong commitment underlined in Viet Nam’s 2nd Voluntary National Review (VNR) outlining 6 prioritiesfor SDG acceleration. Theother five priorities[KP1]are in: 1) science, technology and innovation; 2) quality human resource development; 3) efficient resource management, climate change adaptation and mitigation, and green and circular economy; 4) finance; and 5) data availability.\n\nAll six priorities are envisioned to generate large multiplier effects across SDGs to promote economic prosperity, while protecting human and environmental wellbeing. These are also re-affirmed as the“action points” adopted at the Summit of the Futurein September 2024.\n\nHow will the macroeconomic modelling take forward the priorities for SDG acceleration?\n\nOne important follow up is through this joint UN-MPI macroeconomic modelling exercise. The modelling shows what impacts government investments in national development priorities have on economic, social and environmental outcomes. The modeling measures impact, for example, government investments in renewable energy and digital transformation,  on GDP growth, poverty rate and CO2 emissions.\n\nI would like to highlight three key messages from the study to inspire further discussion:\n\nIn a nutshell, this macroeconomic modelling shows that theeconomic and environmental benefits can be realized through the investments in key transition areas such as renewable energy and energy efficiency, human capital investment (i.e., health, education and social protection), and digital infrastructure.Meanwhile, the pressures on the government’s fiscal space subside over time because the economic and development benefits outweigh the costs.\n\nThe macro-modelling also underlines thatnavigating a balance between prudent public debt management and achievement of long-term development goals is essential.How the investments in development priorities are financed in terms of size, composition and pace has a direct impact on public debt. This underlines the importance of calibration of the financing strategy, approach and mobilization of various sources of finance, including private capital.\n\nIn closing, I am encouraged to learn from MPI that the results of this joint macro-modelling will be used as an input for the preparations for Party Congress 2026. The results of this macro-modelling can also support Viet Nam to prepare and engage inthe 4th International Conference on Financing for Development (FfD4)to be held in Seville, Spain, in June 2025.\n\nUltimately, our hope is that the empirical evidence generated from this macro-modelling is relevant and useful for informing policy choices and crafting policy pathways, including financing strategy, suitable for Viet Nam to accelerate SDG progress, leaving no one behind.Thank you! Xin cam on!\n\n[KP1]As the human-centred development policies and actions, which is the first priority, is already mentioned, there are only other five priorities."}]}

After this challenging year, during which Viet Nam has shown great resilience, I welcome this opportunity to reflect on human rights and this year’s global theme: equality.\n\n- Equality is an issue that the COVID-19 pandemic has brought sharply into focus around the globe.\n\n- The pandemic has highlighted and exposed underlying structural inequalities and fundamental problems in various areas of social, economic, civil and political life which exist in many parts of the world.\n\n- Although this is not a challenge that has suddenly appeared in Viet Nam, the virus has exacerbated existing inequalities and created new ones. The 2020 assessments of UN agencies in Viet Nam already showed that the effects of the outbreaks hit some communities harder than others.\n\n- Despite ongoing Government efforts to control the virus, mitigate its impacts and roll-out vaccines, rapid assessments conducted this year indicate that the context worsened as the pandemic became more severe.\n\n- UNDP and its partners found that since July 2021, 88% of vulnerable households suffered laid-off wage workers, temporary breaks from work, or reduced working hours. In October 2020, this ratio was 63%. Income drops have also been considerably higher, with incomes in July being on average only 44% of December 2019 levels.\n\n- The impacts are not equal across society, and some groups are disproportionately affected by the pandemic. For example, households in tourism and related services suffered the greatest impacts, with informal workers and those in rural areas most affected.\n\n- These impacts are compounded for those in LGBTQI+ groups, people with disabilities, and ethnic communities.\n\n- Research by UNDP and UN Women shows that, in 2020, the pandemic affected the employment of 68.6% of ethnic minority households, compared with 58.4% of Kinh households. Unfortunately, many of these groups also represent those who have had greater difficulty in benefiting from the social protection package rolled out by the Government in rapid response to the fourth wave of COVID-19.\n\n- These challenges have required vulnerable households to take immediate action, like putting less food on the table, reducing electricity usage, and taking out loans. In such circumstances, it is understandable that two-thirds of respondents indicated having mental health problems, particularly female household heads and migrants.\n\n- The social and economic fallout could have a long-term impact on gender equality, threatening the progress made, potentially pushing millions of women and girls below the poverty line worldwide, and putting them at risk of gender-based violence.\n\n- The recent National Study on Violence against Women, supported by UNFPA, showed that nearly 2 in 3 women in Viet Nam experience one or more forms of violence in their lifetime.\n\n- Viet Nam 2021’s Survey on the SDG indicators on children and women, implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic, shows that 70.8% of children aged 1-14 years were subjected to at least one form of psychological or physical punishment by household members.\n\n- The high prevalence rate of violence against women and children has increased in the world of COVID-19, and Viet Nam is no exception.\n\n- UNFPA launched the first-ever one-stop service centre for survivors of violence amid COVID-19, and the number of calls for help increased 2-3 times with the outbreak of the pandemic, receiving more than 1,000 calls every month.\n\n- Along with the Peace House Shelters and the Center for Women and Development, UNWOMEN responded to increased demand for support, training an additional 292 social workers in emergency support services for women and child survivors of violence, as well as providing a modified hotline and updated facilities for three shelters to meet heightened need.\n\n- In addition, in the UNFPA’s modelling analysis, the maternal mortality ratio is likely to increase by 44-65% due to the negative consequence of COVID-19, indicating a reversal of developmental gains made by Viet Nam in the past decades.\n\n- Assessments confirm that Many children are at the risk of falling into multidimensional deprivation, including income poverty and lack of access to essential support and services such as quality education and learning opportunities, nutrition, healthcare, water and sanitation, hygiene, social assistance and child protection.\n\n- Boys and girls aged 16-17 years are even more vulnerable as they are not considered children under the Law on Children, thus excluded from essential protection that is critical to develop their potential, in safety, before reaching full adulthood.\n\n- Viet Nam 2021’s Survey on the SDG indicators on children and women also indicated that almost half of children living in the poorest households did not receive any social transfers or benefits, leaving them vulnerable to economic hardship and social exclusion.\n\n- These statistics raise concerns. It suggests the need for us to challenge our assumptions, change approaches and simply work together to address these disparities.\n\n- These challenges hinder enjoyment of the rights to access employment, education, food, information, social assistance, basic services, as well as the rights to choose freely and responsibly the number, spacing and timing of children.\n\n- Other issues brought to the fore are freedom of expression, in particular online, and freedom of movement.\n\n- Restrictions to these rights and fundamental freedoms, enshrined in international human rights treaties that Viet Nam has ratified, should only be imposed where they meet the principles of legality, necessity, proportionality, serve a legitimate public health objective and represent the least intrusive approach required to achieve that result.\n\nDistinguished guests, Ladies and Gentlemen,\n\n- Since the outbreak of the pandemic, the UN at all levels has emphasised that response and recovery efforts must have the principles of Leaving No One Behind and human rights at their core.\n\n- Viet Nam is presented with many opportunities to ensure that this message becomes a reality. For example, a focus on equitable digitalisation, inclusive employment and strengthening the social protection system, will further human rights and help insulate the country from future disasters.\n\n- The UN in Viet Nam will continue to work hand in hand with the Government to counter the negative effects of COVID-19 and to reinforce the foundations of a more equal future.\n\n- Just as Viet Nam has previously made great strides to reduce multi-dimensional poverty, we are convinced that it will do so again.\n\n- By keeping human rights at the centre of its efforts, Viet Nam will be able to recover lost ground and continue to work towards achieving equality and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\n\n- I would like to turn briefly to the other purpose of today’s event and commend Viet Nam once more on its decision to prepare its first voluntary UPR Mid-Term Report.\n\n- On Human Rights Day 2020, the then Resident Coordinator highlighted this reporting mechanism as an opportunity for Viet Nam to put even greater energy into enhancing the full protection and enjoyment of human rights, as well as strengthening its compliance with international obligations and commitments.\n\n- Ms. Caitlin Wiesen, Resident Representative of UNDP Viet Nam and current Chair of the UN Results Group on Governance and Justice, will present suggestions on how to further strengthen this revised draft, but I take this opportunity to congratulate you on the efforts taken in this process.\n\n- I hope they will help accelerate the implementation of the 3rd cycle recommendations.\n\n- Finally, I will close by noting with great appreciation that today we will hear from a member of Viet Nam’s vibrant and engaged youth. I look forward to learning your aspirations for your country.\n\n- The UN in Viet Nam has observed time and again the commitment of young people to building a more equal and inclusive society. When the future of Viet Nam rests in such motivated hands, we can only be filled with hope.\n\nThank you. Xin cảm ơn!"}]}

We express our heartfelt condolences to those who have lost their lives and suffered due to the pandemic. We welcome the Government Resolution 128 on economic recovery and safe adaptation to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nWe agree with you that the next 6 months will be critical for Viet Nam in sustaining its socio-economic recovery and building back better, particularly for vulnerable populations, including those most at risk of being left behind and impacted severely by the pandemic, while finding ways to safely live with the virus.\n\nThe UN has been playing a key role in bringing millions of COVID-19 vaccines to Viet Nam through the COVAX, as well as in helping the authorities with the rollout of the vaccination operation.  We stand ready to continue to support and work more closely with your Government in this critical period of socio-economic recovery and building back better.\n\nViet Nam’s Contributions to the UN\n\nWe highly values Viet Nam’s contributions to the UN system, including UN peace operations.  Viet Nam’s role at the regional and global levels is increasing, and we welcome its strong support to multilateralism and global cooperation.\n\nIn a vivid show of solidarity, Viet Nam has received in April this year, for the first time in history, a UN staff with COVID through the UN Medical Evacuation system and successfully treated him. As a Security Council member for 2020-21, Viet Nam hosted a premier International Conference on Women, Peace and Security in December 2020. Its outcome document, ‘Hanoi Commitment to Action’, was co-sponsored by 75 Member States.\n\nAs Viet Nam will celebrate the 45th anniversary of its UN membership in 2022, we look forward to closer collaboration with the Government and people of Viet Nam.\n\nNewcooperation framework\n\nThis moment is critical to the UN in Viet Nam as we are finalizing the next Cooperation Framework (CF for short) between UN and the Government of Viet Nam for the period of 2022 to 2026.  We expect the document to be on your table shortly for your final review and approval.\n\nThis is a ‘new generation’ CF following the UN Development System reform, and is anchored in UN guiding principles, norms and standards, in particular the principle of Leaving No One Behind and Human Rights Based Approach.  The whole UN system, including from the regional and global levels, will engage more nimbly and flexibly than before to support the Government and the people of Viet Nam in the following 4 outcome areas to support the Government’s new SEDS and SEDP:\n\nRespective UN agency country frameworks of cooperation have been much more aligned with the CF, and we wish to emphasize the importance of strengthening partnerships with all stakeholders including domestic and international private sector entities and NGOs in its implementation.\n\nYour Excellency,\n\nToday, I would like to highlight several key agendas which we believe the Government of Viet Nam should address as a priority.\n\nThe Government may focus on implementing reforms that make the social assistance system more shock responsive and more inclusive.  This implies meeting the urgent needs of most vulnerable groups more quickly and effectively, linking them with essential services.\n\nIn the short term, we propose a cash assistance programme of not less than 5% of quarterly GDP to be implemented as soon as possible in the final months of 2021 and the first quarter of 2022. The Government has the capacity to borrow domestically to increase cash transfers to poor and vulnerable people, especially women, children and youth, informal and migrant workers, persons with disabilities, LGBTIQ and older people. This will not only reduce their suffering but will also support domestic consumption growth, which many businesses, especially micro, small and medium enterprises, rely on to survive during the recovery and in the lead up to the Tet holidays, as Tet sales account for up to half or even more of annual business.\n\nMedium-term support policies need to be designed now to prepare for the social distancing measures in the future. Reforms should make use of a robust electronic registration system and electronic payment systems as well as augmenting the capacity and resources of provincial governments to identify the neediest and to respond rapidly to their needs.\n\nComplementing social protection, the social rebound must include adequate investment to strengthen grassroots health and nutrition care services and emphasize choice in sexual and reproductive health, as well as to increase access to water and sanitation services. Likewise, efforts are needed to close the digital divide in education and prevent school drop-out following the long periods of distance learning.  Increases in domestic and gender-based violence and mental health concerns during the pandemic call for improved social work services at local levels.\n\nWe recognize that the 26th session of Conference of Parties of UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP 26) will be convened soon and you will lead the delegation of Viet Nam.\n\nCOP26 provides the opportunity for the Government to announce a carbon neutral target year and commit to the urgent actions needed to achieve that target. Possible action points include, increasing commitments on the Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC), enhancing the energy transition to renewables, and ending dependence on coal/ fossil fuels.\n\nIn addition to these, greater investments are required to improve the resilience of vulnerable communities through disaster risk reduction and adaptation to the negative effects of climate change, and to implement for all the newly approved UN human right to a clean, healthy, and sustainable environment.\n\nWe welcome Government initiatives that continue to invest in Viet Nam’s success in addressing multi-dimensional poverty. First, in relation to ethnic minorities, and second in recognising the vulnerabilities of migrant workers and informal workers, especially women, and to implement reforms that formalise their contributions and status in the society and the economy, also in enhancing productivity.  We also recognize Viet Nam’s commitment to transforming food systems in a transparent, responsible, and sustainable manner.\n\nIn supporting businesses with incentives to drive an inclusive green economic rebound, it is important for the Government to engage with the business and labour sectors to promote gender inclusive fair business practices and decent work, as part of the transition to a circular economy. These include education and skill training for the most vulnerable,  investments based on innovations to take advantage of industrial revolution 4.0 technologies. Care must be taken so as not to widen the digital divide.\n\nFundamental to efforts at scale to build back better and leave no one behind is sustainable development financing, including mobilizing domestic public and private resources. It includes greater and more efficient use of public investment resources and the development and reform of domestic institutions that increase the supply of long-term innovative financing schemes that invest in national priorities especially in health and education capacities to rebound from the pandemic and transform economy and society to reach high income status.\n\nIn the context of incremental improvements in governance and public administration performance during the last decade, the Government may wish to consider further reforms that promote a shift to more open and participatory governance systems that are less fragmented, more consistent and responsive, especially in confronting multiple and persistent crises.\n\nInitial steps could enhance innovation capacities to improve coordination across government, to better balance national and provincial responsibilities, and to take advantage of electronic systems (such as national ID) to make services and resources more accessible to all, and thereby enhancing a more agile, anticipatory, and adaptive governance response and policy making based on relevant data and evidence.\n\nConclusion\n\nWe stand ready to discuss and initiate joint work with the Government where and when your government sees our contributions’ adding value to your efforts.\n\nFinally, I would like to thank you for offering us this meeting and time for discussion. After your excellency’s response, and when you allow, I will invite my UNCT representatives to help respond and elaborate further our key messages.\n\nTHANK YOU!"}]}

Together with the Government of Viet Nam, we - as the UN, have agreed on how to move closer to realizing the SDGs. As such, the CF is key in guiding how we bring about sustainable development for all in Viet Nam.\n\nExcellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,\n\nThe road leading up to this ceremony today was neither easy nor smooth.  We have faced obstacles and delays. Many of these were caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.  The pandemic is a crisis is unprecedented in its reach and consequences. It also presents an unparalleled opportunity for accelerating progress on the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development as we build back forward from the pandemic. For the UN, the pandemic made us more convinced of the primacy of Leaving No One Behind. The Principle of Leaving No One Behind runs through the CF as the fundamental commitment of the UN in Viet Nam. Ensuring that No One is Left Behind requires a broad, whole-of-government and whole-of-society approach. I feel confident that we - who are meeting here today - are agents of change, ensuring that Viet Nam can tap into its adaptive, industrious and growing population to spur long-term sustainable development for all, while protecting the planet. The CF also reflects a strong commitment to the principles of human rights, gender equality and women’s empowerment, and the obligations to international standards and treaties.\n\nDeveloping the CF has been a joint undertaking, and I would like to express our sincere appreciation to MPI, and in particular to H.E Minister Nguyen Chi Dung, for leading the Government’s close engagement with the UN. Armed with knowledge through analysis and inter-disciplinary dialogue, the Government of Viet Nam and the UN have prioritised four development outcomes:\n\n•Inclusive social development, with a focus on inclusive, gender responsive, disability sensitive, equitable, affordable and quality social services and social protection, with the aim of freeing people in Viet Nam from poverty in all its dimensions and empowering people to reach their full potential;\n\n•Climate change response, disaster resilience and environmental sustainability, with a focus on a safer and cleaner environment as a result of Viet Nam’s effective mitigation and adaptation to climate change, disaster risk reduction and resilience building, promotion of circular economy, the provision of clean and renewable energy, and the sustainable management of natural resources;\n\n•Shared prosperity through economic transformation, with a focus on sustainable, inclusive and gender-responsive economic transformation based on innovation, entrepreneurship, enhanced productivity, competitiveness and decent work; and\n\n•Governance and access to justice, with a focus on improved governance, more responsive institutions, strengthened rule of law and the protection of and respect for human rights, gender equality, and freedom from all forms of violence and discrimination in line with international standards.\n\nNeedless to say, a lot of work has gone into identifying and specifying these priority outcomes. We have drawn on best practices from around the globe to ensure that each outcome is underpinned by a scientifically robust theory of change. In July last year, we gained invaluable feedback from a multi-stakeholder consultation. I suppose that many of you have participated in this process. Your comments, feedback and active engagement have made this document more solid and substantive. Of this, I feel both proud, and incredibly grateful!\n\nExcellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,\n\n2022 is the first year of the CF, and we have already begun our work.  As we embark on this journey together with the Government of Viet Nam, I would like to highlight three key points:\n\nFirst, we live in an uncertain and turbulent world.We are already seeing the effects of the triple planetary crisis – climate change, pollution, and loss of biodiversity. The last few years have shown, with brutal clarity, that crises can emerge and evolve quickly. The world as we know it can change and change fast. Recent crises have brought severe impact on food security, fuel and commodity prices, the global supply chains and financing. We may just be witnessing the beginning of worsening disruptions and turbulence yet to come. We have also seen how one crisis compounds another. The interlinkages in this global village can no longer be overlooked; it is evident. Against this backdrop - and more so than ever - we need to reaffirm and strengthen our commitment to multilateralism and global solidarity. We know that Viet Nam is a strong supporter of the UN, and trust that Viet Nam is poised to work closely with us as we take on more complex challenges. I believe that the UN can only be successful as a multilateral organization if we are able to bring diverse stakeholders to co-create solutions.\n\nSecond,we need to arm ourselves with knowledge and foresightto ensure that we stand ready to meet the world of tomorrow. As with the global pandemic, we have learnt that change and disruption come without warning. Knowledge is, in fact, our most valuable resource. As Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh stressed at a meeting on macro-economy, held on 30 July, we “need to be bold and armed with knowledge, vision and breakthrough spirit”. He emphasized the need for stronger capability in forecasting to predict risks and seize opportunities. The UN stands ready to make substantive contributions with our global network of knowledge and access to expertise. My commitment to you is to use the CF as flexibly as possible, keeping it as a living document, focusing on what is the most needed within the four broad outcomes and co-designing with the Government and people of Viet Nam relevant development solutions and options. I also commit myself to making the UN as creative and innovative as possible, ensuring our approach remains effective, efficient and provides value.\n\nThird, we need resources to implement the CF. Again, with MPI leading from within the Government, we are beginning the process of developing our joint resource mobilization and partnership strategy for the CF. Our strategy needs to be future facing, evidence-informed and adaptive to the fast-changing development context and financing landscape. We know that ODA to Viet Nam is expected to shrink in the upcoming years. Development finance as we know it needs to be reimagined to better serve today and tomorrow. This poses a major challenge for the formulation of the strategy but also for the actual mobilization of resources. Together, we can improve the way we mobilize non-traditional donors, find innovative cost-sharing arrangements and team up with the private sector to bring about change. I believe that we must take a whole-of-society approach, whereby we harness the capacity and resources for stronger collaboration. Here, I want to reiterate UN’s commitment to building on the strong partnership between the Government of Viet Nam and the UN in accelerating progress to achieve the 2030 Agenda for sustainable development and the SDGs.\n\nWe cannot predict the future. But we can design and work together for the present and the future that leaves no one behind. I am excited to work with all of you present here today and with new partners with innovation, knowledge and foresight.\n\nThank you, Xin Cam on."}]}

Such reflections will lay the foundation for a greater inclusion, human rights and quality of lives of the estimated one-in-seven adults and children who live with some form of disability.\n\nNearly two year has passed since world leaders at the United Nations endorsed the new global development agenda to help “Transform our World”. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development with 17 Sustainable Development Goals is a commitment to eliminate poverty, exclusion and violence. To achieve the SDGs in Viet Nam, the specific needs of people with disabilities must be considered in each and every goal. In June last year, the Government approved the National Plan of Action to implement the Convention on the Rights of the Persons with Disabilities. Such progress is ground-breaking for Viet Nam to follow through its commitments under the Convention and the SDGs.\n\nSince the ratification, the UN in Viet Nam has been working closely with the relevant Government agencies to develop the National Plan of Action, and to strengthen monitoring mechanisms, including the development of monitoring indicators ahead of the country’s first review on the implementation of the Convention. Human rights monitoring can play a key role in supporting States to effectively implement the Convention at national level.  Effective monitoring will also help persons with disabilities to become increasingly aware of their rights, therefore bringing about positive change in the lives of persons with disabilities.\n\nHuman rights work requires preparation, technical skills and substantive knowledge in order to be effectively conducted. Therefore, I hope our discussion at this conference will facilitate knowledge sharing, open discussion, and assist Disabled Persons Organizations, Persons with Disabilities and other human rights monitors—including from Governments, non-governmental organizations—to engage in monitoring the rights of persons with disabilities, in line with the Convention.\n\nWomen and children with disabilities are too often amongst the most marginalized in all societies and face unique challenges in the enjoyment of human rights. For a long time it was assumed that such challenges were the unavoidable consequences of their physical, mental, or sensory impairment. I hope the discussion will pay special attention to the unique challenges that women and children with disabilities are faced, and facilitate positive solutions.\n\nDisabilities rights are human rights. Looking ahead, the UN stands ready to provide support in a number of areas to remain a committed partner in helping to “make rights real” for persons with disabilities in Viet Nam. UN is committed to provide support to the Government of Viet Nam to make policies and programmes to align with Convention and support achievement of related SDG targets. That includes the support to have accurate data on adults and children with disabilities for effective policy development and programming of interventions; and develop standards for inclusive services for persons with disabilities among them early identification and interventions of children with disabilities is crucial. Monitoring the inclusion, non-discrimination and protection of rights with participation of Organisations of Persons with Disabilities will remain a central part of our collective efforts.\n\nLet me finish by underlining the UN’s continued commitment to work with the Government, CSOs and all other stakeholders for Viet Nam where everyone has the right to live full, productive and meaningful life. I hope the discussions will be fruitful toward our collective action to protect and ensure the full and equal enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms by all persons with disabilities.\n\nThank you."}]}

The National Council for Sustainable Development and Competitiveness Improvement and the Vietnam Business Council for Sustainable Development of the Vietnam Chamber of Commerce and Industry have made commendable efforts in bringing together leaders and decision-makers from the public and private sectors, both nationally and internationally. We are here to determine how best we can federate our actions towards sustainable and equitable development.\n\nThis conference is therefore critical in taking forward our joint efforts to achieve the United Nations' and global community's Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development in Viet Nam. In fact, the development of an \"Action Plan of the Government and the Private Sector on Enhancing Productivity and Competitiveness for Sustainable Development in the backdrop of Industry 4.0\" will prove to be an essential instrument in those efforts. This Action Plan should complement and enrich national strategies aimed at \"Leaving No One Behind\", such as the National Action Plan to implement the Sustainable Development Goals.\n\nDistinguished Guests,\n\nIt is important to take a step back to determine how best our joint efforts can have a positive impact on the lives of the Vietnamese people. As the United Nations, we are delighted to see Viet Nam take action towards a \"Whole of Society\" approach for sustainable development. This is very well demonstrated by the rich and diverse gathering under a common agenda here today.\n\nThe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the 17 associated Sustainable Development Goals, are framed by the 5 P's of sustainable development – people, prosperity, partnership, planet and peace. This agenda shifts the emphasis of business from a focus on profit to working towards collective prosperity. Likewise, Governments are called to work under a \"Whole of Government\" approach to most efficiently use national resources. Underlying all these efforts is the principle of \"Leaving No One Behind\".\n\nAgenda 2030 cannot be attained by Governments alone, it requires the active participation of all members of society. Moreover, these goals can only be achieved with sufficient and coordinated financial investment. We, therefore, anticipate that the Action Plan on Enhancing Productivity and Competitiveness for Sustainable Development will also propose financing strategies that seek to attract sources of appropriate financing, including public and private, domestic and international.\n\nDistinguished Guests,\n\nWhat I have just outlined is the bigger picture context. The theme of today's sustainable development conference highlights Industry 4.0 as a key underlying factor. New technologies are transforming the way we produce, work, learn, and live throughout the world. Our economies are changing. This includes new forms of proprietary rights, new modes of governance, and new business models. How we adapt and transform these realities into opportunities is the fundamental question we must pose.\n\nIndustry 4.0 is bringing widespread automation and irreversible shifts in the structure of jobs. Millions of jobs could soon be performed by machines; and that means that millions of workers, disproportionately women workers, will need new skills to pursue new forms of work. Industry 4.0 may create new opportunities for economic, social and individual development, but it may also create new security risks, increase poverty and inequality, and lead to serious social challenges.\n\nEstimates of the share of automatable employment vary widely, from 14% of all jobs in OECD countries, to nearly 50% of all jobs in the US. According to the McKinsey Global Institute, 9-32% of the total employment in developed economies could be displaced within the next decade.\n\nIn Asia, some 43 million people are employed in the garment, textile, and footwear industries, with women accounting for three-quarters of this total employment. For Vietnam, 86% of employees in textile and footwear sectors, which include 13.2% non-agricultural jobs, are facing considerable risk of joblessness. Notably, these sectors have facilitated female empowerment and lifted entire generations out of poverty. But what will Industry 4.0 in this sector mean for women in Viet Nam?\n\nThe automation and digitalization of production processes could mean a loss of comparative advantage in terms of low cost labour for Viet Nam. Consequently, it is highly crucial that Vietnam increases its productivity and competitiveness at all levels to strengthen its contribution and value added to global value chains.\n\nAs Industry 4.0 technologies are embedded into production processes, there will be a rapid and sustainable rise in productivity and competitive power. From this perspective, absorbing these technologies should be the window of opportunity for a future Vietnam if it is to become an engine of the new growth model. This will require a significant transformation in the current economic model.\n\nViet Nam's recent experiences since 'Doi Moi' have been remarkable. It has seen a dramatic reduction of poverty, sustained high economic growth rates, and high levels of exports, which together have contributed to its economic and social transformation. However, this transformation was from a very low economic base and can now only be sustained and taken to the next level if there is a consistent and simultaneous implementation of higher value-added productivity, appropriate institutional strengthening, and tailored and appropriate good governance policies. Viet Nam will therefore need to transform its economic structure from one based on resource-driven growth to one which is driven by high productivity-based economic growth if it is to avoid the middle-income trap or worse still, become stuck in a lower middle-income trap.\n\nLadies and Gentlemen,\n\nWhile this debate is nascent, a number of solutions are being proposed and in some cases tested. Going forward, and being at the forefront of tomorrow's economy today, will require that policy and decision-making processes are more inclusive and deliberative in producing solutions that more closely reflect societal needs, boost economic competitiveness and inclusive growth, while creating jobs.\n\nA Universal Basic Dividend, financed from returns on capital, would help citizens recoup or replace some of the income lost to automation. Taxes on robots are also being proposed to diminish income inequalities. Tax policies and other incentives can further be used to support the private sector's investment in labour training, especially by and for SMEs. Governments should also offer universal social benefits like health care, child care, and retirement security, as well as transition support to employees who are forced to change jobs.\n\nEmployees must be educated and trained to use increasingly high-tech tools; and redistributive policies should be introduced to maintain an equitable distribution of income. Employers and industry groups need to be in closer contact with educational institutions so that the skills they supply meet current and future demand. And, technology companies must do better at collaborating with manufacturers. Job mortgages and apprenticeship programmes, where companies support their staff with training and acquiring new skills, could also provide important avenues for potential solutions.\n\nCheap and semi-skilled labour are no longer a strategic advantage in the global economy, nor are tax incentives in special economic zones, if they ever have been. Policymakers should focus on policies, strong institutions, and strengthening education and adult-learning programs, for people who are left behind by the driving force of automation. These policies are best spearheaded by public-private cooperation. Women will also need to play a larger role in the formal economy compared to the informal economy if Vietnam is to benefit from a gender dividend.\n\nDistinguished guests,\n\nToday's conference is an important step in adapting our policies, strategies and actions in a concerted manner and in line with the inevitable shifts which are occurring in our economies.\n\nAs the 2030 Agenda requires the integration of all dimensions of sustainable development, new technologies should be used as an accelerator for SDG implementation and achievement. The UN in Vietnam will therefore continue to support integrated solutions which create significant opportunity for SDG attainment, including through the opportunities provided by Industry 4.0.\n\nThe UN Country Team in Viet Nam has been working closely with start-ups, entrepreneurs and technology innovators in Viet Nam to promote SDG Entrepreneurship, where businesses put achieving the Sustainable Development Goals at the centre of their business models. The SDG market, representing the potential amount of money that could be made by developing innovations that help achieve the SDGs, is expected to total USD 13 trillion by 2030, and we are encouraging businesses to explore more how they can both contribute to, and benefit from, helping achieve the SDGs.\n\nGoing forward, the domestic and international private sector in Viet Nam should play a key role in strengthening sustainable development, and should now be regarded as a full-fledged member of the social community.\n\nBusinesses have a responsibility to respect international standards, such as on human rights. The UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights were published in 2011, and recognize that as the private sector has grown in its power and influence in recent years, so too has their impact on society, and with this growth comes increased social, economic and environmental responsibilities. We look forward to working with all stakeholders to move forward the business and human rights agenda in Viet Nam, including Government, civil society actors and business leaders.\n\nLadies and Gentlemen,\n\nLet me conclude by saying that the UN in Viet Nam will continue to engage on and facilitate important policy debates as well as support the implementation of policies which ensure that no one is left behind. In this spirit, we have supported the Government in the preparation of its Voluntary National Review on the SDGs which will be presented by it at the High Level Political Forum in just over ten days in New York on 16 July 2018 to which I will accompany the Vietnamese delegation led by MPI.\n\nI trust that through the active and fruitful discussions at this conference, you will be able to identify sound solutions, including innovative and concrete joint actions which should become the essential core of the new partnerships needed to fully achieve the Sustainable Development Goals before or by 2030.\n\nThank you! Xin Cảm Ơn!"}]}

It is to hear more about your perspectives on the sustainable development path of Viet Nam.\n\nI do not think I need to tell you we are living in a world that is facing some very complex challenges. Natural disasters are becoming more frequent and extreme, more difficult to predict, and with stronger effects. Rising temperatures bring rising sea levels that pose grave threats to coastal cities and communities everywhere, and biodiversity loss endangers whole ecosystems.   And now, we understand only too well how health-related pandemics, themselves symptoms of biodiversity loss and our growing contact with pathogens once hidden in dark forests, make everything so much more complicated.\n\nTo be honest with you, the people of my generation have not done very well with these challenges, and we are leaving you a difficult legacy. But we also know as professionals - and as parents too - that you are uniquely talented, having grown up with technology and accustomed to rapid change. If there was ever a generation ready to face these challenges, to save the world, it is your generation.  We watch young people today demanding a role in the global dialogue on climate change and you are making your voices heard in the most inspiring ways. Today, we gather to recognize and support the initiative that young women and men already demonstrate every day in Viet Nam to protect the environment, raise awareness, and take actions in your communities and within your own families.\n\nIn this regard, I would like to welcome the impressive group of young students, volunteers, activists and entrepreneurs with us in the Green One UN House today and I would like to thank all of you who join the conversation through the virtual dialogue.\n\nDear friends,\n\nThe event today is symbolic of the ever-stronger partnership between the Ho Chi Minh Communist Youth Union and the United Nations, united in our common belief that supporting youth empowerment in Viet Nam is one of the most important contributions we can make to the development of the nation. We want to continue hearing from you and to continue to work with you - our commitment to you is total and year-round, not just for a day. Together, we join hands for a more resilient and prosperous Viet Nam, where no one is left behind.\n\nToday is your day. Enjoy and have a great celebration!\n\nXin cam on / Thank you"}]}

And it is an honor to be on this panel with Ambassador Madame Nga, a longtime UNIS supporter, to engage with you all.\n\nAs we begin today, let us take a moment to look back in history. On 24 October 1945, the United Nations came into being, following the signature by 50 Member States of the United Nations Charter on 26 June 1945. The enduring UN Charter clearly sets out the need to put people at the center, in fact it starts with three critical words, “We the Peoples”. This message still resonates strongly today in 2020 as we celebrate the 75th anniversary of the UN.\n\nThe journey of 75 years has not been easy for either the UN or the world, but it is worth remembering that the UN has fulfilled all the major objectives, it was originally established to achieve—notably, preventing a Third World War and ensuring the independence of most previously non-self governing territories and countries, as well as in its normative role of establishing human rights and other international norms and standards—and even on development where progress on poverty reduction, health, education, maternal mortality and in many other areas has been unprecedented in world history from the time that the UN was established. It is also the only legitimate and universal organization where 193 Member States gather and, overall, despite its deficiencies which largely reflect the deficiencies of its Member States, the world is a much better place for it. If the UN did not exist, we would need to reinvent it and it is far from clear that a new body created in 2020 would be better than the one created out of the ashes and destruction of the Second World War.\n\nMoreover, all the talking and dialogue in the UN has been key to preventing a Third World War and containing the Cold War and many conflicts and tensions of the last three decades after the Cold War. Indeed, working towards common goals and solutions for 193 countries through inter-governmental bodies like the General Assembly or the Security Council is much harder than you might think. As you may experience during this Model UN Conference, it is not an easy task to navigate among different and often conflicting opinions, especially in a world as full of challenges and as divided as it is today.\n\nIn recent years, the world has witnessed growing nationalism and populism. There are divisions around the world putting multilateralism and international cooperation at risk. People of my generation, especially in leadership positions, must make the right decisions for succeeding generations. Young people like yourselves have a key role to play in making your voices heard and in encouraging decision-making so that it goes in the right direction. Youth advocates such as Greta Thunberg and Malala Yousafzai have done so firmly and clearly, demanding a better, safer and more equal future for your and future generations.\n\nAs you begin this model UN, I am sure you are all aware of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals adopted by the UN General Assembly as the most suitable Agenda to help address the serious situation we find ourselves and our world in today. We need to acknowledge the unfortunate but undeniable facts that—if the SDGs had already been addressed or been more advanced in terms of their achievement—and if multilateralism and international cooperation had not been under such attack from some important quarters—the world would have been in a much better position to address COVID-19 than it was when the crisis hit. Unfortunately, also, COVID-19 has put a temporary halt to SDG implementation for all of us, though we have less than 10 years to achieve them. We are at a crossroads, where we need to strengthen our resolve and be united in overcoming the multiple crises in our world. We must turn these crises into opportunities to build forward better and differently towards 2030 and beyond, based on the SDGs.\n\nWe live in an unprecedented time of turbulence and turmoil. The UN Security Council, the world and many key countries in the world are divided in a manner they have not been for a very long time, if ever. The COVID-19 pandemic has simultaneously and irreversibly changed the way we live, as you yourselves have witnessed this past year. Natural disasters–be they earthquakes, tropical storms, or tidal waves–are becoming more powerful and ferocious than before, and we recently witnessed some of this in central Viet Nam. The climate emergency is real, and we have no more time to waste. Man-made disasters – from violent armed conflicts to serious human rights violations – are getting worse as well. Millions of people are deprived of economic opportunities and at least tens of thousands, if not millions, are at risk of slipping back into poverty as a result of the social and economic consequences of COVID-19, because of too little or no official or government assistance or any other form of social protection. Set in this context, the theme of the MUN Conference – Unity in Crisis – delivers a crucial and timely message to the leaders and people around the world today.\n\nThis year, as the Model UN takes place during COVID-19, UNIS Hanoi is one of the luckiest schools in the world, being in a position to organize MUN face-to-face—even if with masks on! You will have a chance to learn how to debate, negotiate and think critically, engaging with your fellow participants in person rather than virtually. People from 193 countries with all kinds of backgrounds and cultures make up the UN organization. One of the key principles in the UN is respect for diversity. I urge you to take into consideration this principle during the Model UN – to respect your friends and teammates thoughts and acknowledge the differences that may arise. As you take substantive matters seriously you should be aware this could lead to heated debates, but we have such debates at the UN on a daily basis, and when handled healthily, they lead to healthy, positive outcomes! I very much hope that you will find concrete positive solutions and agreements through frank exchanges despite your possible diverse perspectives. This is the essence of “unity in crisis”.\n\nIn September, the UN held the 75th session of General Assembly amidst COVID-19 - the first-ever virtual UN General Assembly in its history. Still, world leaders, experts, and youth advocates gathered and concretely agreed on important messages – that we need global solidarity and unity more than ever before to tackle COVID-19 and global challenges, and build forward better and differently for a sustainable, resilient and just future; and that youth must be given more space to raise their voices. I hope that you will all confirm this message through your experience at this Model UN.\n\nThe world needs social and economic inclusion if good decisions are to be made. We need real leaders and statesmen and stateswomen. We need activists and advocates. We need serious thinking, compassionate and value-laden young people and students as well as mature and principled parents and teachers to guide our children, because the decisions we make today will shape the world tomorrow. I encourage all of you to enter the Model UN Conference and SDG Week with the core belief that you are agents of change as well as the belief that even the most serious of challenges can be overcome when we are united.\n\nI thank you for listening. I wish you all the best at the Model UN Conference and during this SDG Week!"}]}

I am glad to welcome our colleagues from the Economist, our partner on this endeavor, who I’m sure needs no introduction as a leading global publication.\n\nThe UN has increasingly taken a more prominent role in addressing the human rights of LGBTI individuals and has helped bring this issue to international attention. The interest of the Economist with a wide readership among decision makers, to raise the profile and create awareness of discrimination faced by LGBTI persons, especially in the context of business, makes this partnership a natural and effective alliance.\n\nThe relevance of the issue of LGBTI inclusion is exemplified by the caliber of organizations and individuals represented in the room here today, and I thank you all for taking the time to be a part of this informal roundtable discussion.\n\nOver the past few years, protection of the rights of LGBTI persons has become central to the work of the UN. While there has no doubt been great progress, it is disheartening that 73 countries around the world today still have criminal laws against sexual activity by lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender or intersex people. There are also worrying trends of oppression against the LGBTI community in many parts of the world.\n\nThis is why, with a focus on protecting the human rights of LGBTI individuals in all aspects of life and society that the UN and UNDP have embraced the LGBTI agenda.\n\nIn Viet Nam, progress has been fast but uneven, with the definition of marriage as being between a man and a woman removed from the Constitution in 2013, and the unbanning of same sex marriage in the revised Law on Marriage and Family in 2014. 2016 marked an important year particularly for transgender individuals, with the passing of legislation which allows those who have undergone gender reassignment to register under their preferred sex, which I am proud to say UNDP, along with partners in the room here today, worked and advocated for.\n\nOf course, legal progress is not the same as elimination of prevailing stigma. Importantly, in the UN Human Rights Council, Vietnam as a member voted in favour of a resolution for the protection of LGBTI persons and the establishment, for the first time, of an Independent Expert on protection against violence and discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity.\n\nDespite such progress there is still considerable work to be done. LGBTI discrimination in business practices remains an important issue in Vietnam. The business sector plays a huge role in protecting the rights of LGBTI persons – certainly some global businesses are so sizeable they outweigh a number of sovereign nations both in terms of resources and influence. They can choose to have non-discriminatory and inclusive hiring practices, they can promote a corporate culture that values diversity and puts an end to bullying and intimidation.\n\nThe rights of all people are enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, including the principle of non-discrimination. While international human rights treaties do not impose legal obligations on enterprises, businesses have tremendous power and ability to affect the enjoyment of human rights, both positively and negatively. Just consider the impact that job creation can have on a range of rights, including the rights to health, education, food and shelter. The rapid economic development that Viet Nam has experienced in recent years must be matched by greater equality and protection for marginalized groups. Growth must be inclusive and sustainable and then benefits of growth accessible to all.\n\nThe role of businesses as organs of society, performing various important functions and services, and the requirement for them to comply with all applicable laws and respect for human rights, is recognized in the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, I hope you are familiar with these. Many of the businesses in this room are shining examples of fulfilling this role, and it is important to showcase good practices, and develop guidance for others to help them recognize and fulfill this role.\n\nIn looking to the future, and building on the progress made in 2016, LGBTI inclusion in business should remain a central part of our respective efforts. Policies and practice of inclusion and non-discrimination in the work place send a strong signal around the world that Business supports equality.\n\nWith that, I again welcome you all here today, and offer many thanks for the support and collaboration of our partners at the Economist for co-hosting this event with us. I hope your discussions will be very fruitful toward our collective action to ensure LGBTI inclusion in business, and support steps toward ensuring equality for everyone.\n\nLadies and gentlemen, thank you.\n\nI would now like to both welcome Charles Goddard, Editorial Director with The Economist Intelligence Unit in Asia-Pacific, to the Green One UN House and also invite him to make his opening remarks."}]}

I am delivering these remarks on behalf of the UNDP Resident Representative in Vietnam, Mr. Kamal Malhotra. It is unfortunate that Mr. Malhotra is not able to be here due to a prior commitment.However, he sends his best wishes for the event and he will participate in the New Year Meeting with International Partners at the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment on 6 February. He has asked me to represent him in the event today as UNDP Country Director ad interim.\n\nAs we know, wetlands play a crucial role in the economic development of a country and support local livelihoods, especially through agriculture and aquaculture. Along the coast, wetlands are also a natural buffer against the impact of typhoons and storm surges, protecting people and development investments.\n\nAt the same time, natural wetlands in Viet Nam remain under pressure; they are not yet designated as Protected Areas, continue to be affected by economic development, while the awareness, institutional arrangements and capacity for wetland management needs further strengthening.\n\nViet Nam is making progress in strengthening wetland conservation. We can see that the need to balance and harmonize economic growth and development with environmental protection is increasingly being recognized, and Viet Nam’s support of the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda is an opportunity both to emphasize the sustainable basis of the economy and bring positive effects on the livelihoods and quality of life of all Vietnamese, as well as to benefit the country’s wetlands.\n\nConsidering their important role, and the threats to which wetlands still are subject, UNDP is proud to support the Government of Viet Nam in strengthening wetland conservation and to ensure their sustainable development in support of local livelihoods. Together with MONRE, ISPONRE and BCA/VEA we support national authorities and 2 pilot provinces – Thai Binh and Thua Thien Hue – in establishing innovative Wetland Conservation Areas and ensuring their effective management. We are working to revise relevant national and provincial legislation in order to mainstream wetland conservation into socio-economic development planning, and to formulate a National Wetlands Action Plan.\n\nLadies and Gentlemen,In Thai Thuy today we can see firsthand, an example of seemingly conflicting interests between industrial development and the conservation of wetland biodiversity. However, we can also see an opportunity to mainstream mangrove wetland protection into industrial development. Thai Thuy’s mangroves help to reduce the impacts of extreme weather events which are increasingly occurring due to climate change. They offer protection of the sea dikes, aquaculture ponds and agricultural lands, and reduce costs for post-disaster relief and infrastructure restoration. Supporting this natural solution to disaster risk reduction is also cost-effective for any planned industry in Viet Nam’s coastal zone.\n\nTherefore, UNDP remains strongly committed to further supporting the integrated conservation and sustainable use of wetlands and biodiversity. We also seek to help the country realize a more sustainable and inclusive economy by improving the livelihoods and quality of life of all of Vietnam’s citizens, as well as by safeguarding Viet Nam’s communities from the impacts of environmental degradation from climate change, both today and for future generations.\n\nThank you – Xin cam on!"}]}

Pham Binh Minh Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of Viet Nam at UN75 Reception\nDate: \n\nLet me start by congratulating you, Mr. Malhotra, and the entire UN Country Team on the 75th anniversary of the foundation of the United Nations.\n\nAs we celebrate this special occasion, I join you here tonight with a sense of pride, and with a message of commitment and hope.\n\nFor three quarters of a century, the United Nations has worked tirelessly for the betterment of the world. As the “centre for harmonizing the actions of nations”, the UN has been at the heart of international efforts to secure peace and promote sustainable development.\n\nThe principles set out in the UN Charter have been fundamental in regulating modern international relations. UN peacekeepers have brought hope to people in conflict-ridden areas. The presence of UN personnel on the ground, in humanitarian activities or development projects, have changed the lives of millions for the better.\n\nThe success and strengths of the UN derives from its special legitimacy, conferred on it by Member States, from an overarching agenda, covering peace and security, development and human rights, that aims to leave no one behind, and from the Organization’s commitment to and promotion of international law. These remain the key to a stronger and more effective United Nations as we move forward.\n\nExcellencies,\n\nLadies and gentlemen,\n\nViet Nam highly appreciates the cooperation with the United Nations.\n\nI remember very vividly the vital food aid and medical supplies provided by UN agencies in the early post-war days.\n\nThe UN has been active and effective in supporting ourDoi moireforms since the very beginning. UN support helped strengthen our legal frameworks and development policies, enhance institution building and human resource development.\n\nUN support contributed meaningfully to Viet Nam’s economic, social and cultural development achievements. Vietnamese women are more empowered, our children better nurtured, jobs made more decent. Our healthcare system is stronger, our agriculture modernized. Our efforts to tackle climate change and environmental challenges have been strengthened.\n\nAs I speak, a UN team of experts just completed a mission to the Central provinces to help assess the impacts of recent storms and floods and devise emergency and long-term responses.\n\nAll this would not have been possible without the dedication, commitment and hard work of each and every UN staff, the close collaboration of Government agencies, and the support of development partners. On behalf of the Government and people of Viet Nam, I thank you all.\n\nThe world we live in today is vastly different from when the UN was founded 75 years ago. But the challenges we are facing are no less daunting. As Secretary-General Antonio Guterres put it, [and I quote] “the world faces its gravest test since the founding of this Organization”.\n\nMultiple crises are ongoing. COVID-19 has not only created a health crisis, but also an economic, social and human crisis. Great power competition, tensions and conflicts, and a lack of commitment to multilateralism are posing serious challenges to the work of the United Nations.\n\nIt is in these times of difficulties that we must work together in solidarity and strengthen multilateralism and international law, with the UN at its core.\n\nViet Nam remains strongly committed to advancing multilateral cooperation and supporting the work of the United Nations. We are working with fellow members of the Security Council to contribute to the maintenance of international peace and security. The Vietnamese flag will be flying at more UN Peacekeeping Missions. Viet Nam is also at the forefront of UN reform, exemplified by progress in implementing Delivering as One. As Chair of ASEAN this year, we are working to advance ASEAN-UN cooperation, including in response to the impacts of COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAs Viet Nam charts its development strategy for the next five and ten years and continues efforts to implement the SDGs, we look forward to the UN’s continued assistance in policy advice, knowledge and experience-sharing, networking and capacity building. It is high time we started preparing the next One Strategic Plan to guide our cooperation, in line with Viet Nam’s development priorities, while taking full advantage of the comparative advantages of all UN agencies.\n\nTo conclude,ladies and gentlemen,I am hopeful, but also extremely confident that the United Nations will continue to be the beacon of multilateral cooperation, the incubator of ideas and initiatives for global peace and development, and that the Viet Nam – UN partnership will continue to grow from strength to strength.\n\nI thank you./."}]}

Let me at the outset thank the Viet Nam National Committee on Ageing, General Office for Population and Family Planning (GOPFP), Viet Nam Association of the Elderly, and HelpAge for co-hosting and co-organizing today's talk-show on the occasion of the International Day for Older Persons, which is celebrated across the world on 1 October to raise awareness of how vital older people are as a part of the community and break down age discrimination. And today we mark this day with the theme of \"Celebrating Older Human Rights Champions\".\n\nDistinguished guests,\n\nWe are all getting older. This is a fact of life.\n\nOne in nine persons is aged 60 or older. This is projected to increase to one in five by 2050.\n\nBetween 2015 and 2030, the target date for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, the number of older persons worldwide is set to increase by 56 per cent—from 901 million to more than 1.4 billion. By 2030, the number of people aged 60 and above will exceed that of people aged 15 to 24.\n\nIn Viet Nam, the proportion of older persons in the total population has increased to 11.9 per cent in 2017, and will be doubled to 20 per cent in 2038. As the world sets out an inspirational new development agenda, and commits to reaching the new Sustainable Development Goals, Viet Nam must envision a new paradigm that aligns demographic ageing with economic and social growth and protects the human rights of older persons.\n\nAgeing is a triumph of development. We must now turn our focus from merely helping people reach old age to helping them reach a happy old age.\n\nLadies and gentlemen,\n\nToday's talk-show aims to raise awareness about ageing population and the need to ensure that people can grow old with dignity and continue to participate in society as citizens with full rights. We will hear inspiring stories from both older persons and younger persons and we hope to spread the message that older persons are a benefit to society, not a cost or a burden.\n\nOlder persons can be active and forward-looking participants in society. We must no longer treat older people as passive recipients of social services.\n\nDistinguished guests,\n\nAs we step towards the better future we all want, 'leaving no one behind' will mean making space for the contributions of older persons. Let us promote the rights and ensure the full participation of older persons to build better societies for all ages.\n\nThank you, and wishing you all health, happiness and success this International Day of Older Persons – and always.\n\nXin cam on."}]}

Nguyen Phuong Nga, President of the Viet Nam Union of Friendship Organizations\n\nExcellency Mr. Yaron Mayer, Ambassador of the State of Israel to Viet Nam;\n\nExcellency Mr. Guido Erpo Hildner, Ambassador of the Federal Republic of Germany;\n\nExcellencies, Ambassadors, Members of the Diplomatic Corps;\n\nLadies and Gentlemen;\n\nOn the occasion of the International Day of Commemoration in Memory of the Victims of the Holocaust, 27 January, United Nations Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres, delivered remarks, key parts of which I would like to quote today.\n\nI QUOTE:\n\n“Ninety years ago this year, the Nazi party came to power in Germany.\n\nWithin months, they dismantled fundamental constitutional rights and paved the way for totalitarian rule.\n\nMembers of Parliament were swiftly arrested, freedom of the press abolished.\n\nDiscrimination and exclusion – codified in law – began almost immediately.\n\nOpen, organized violence – most notoriously the terror of the Kristallnacht – followed soon after, alongside widespread theft and plunder.\n\nBy the end of the war, six million children, women, and men – nearly two out of every three European Jews – had been murdered.\n\nThe rise of National Socialism in Germany was made possible by the indifference – if not connivance – of so many millions.\n\nWe now know the terrifying depths of the abyss into which Germany would plunge.\n\nBut the alarm bells were already ringing in 1933. Too few bothered to listen, and fewer still spoke out.\n\nToday, we can hear echoes of those same siren songs to hate.\n\nFrom an economic crisis that is breeding discontent…\n\nto populist demagogues using the crisis to seduce voters …\n\nto runaway misinformation, paranoid conspiracy theories and unchecked hate speech…\n\nto growing disregard for human rights and disdain for the rule of law…\n\nto surging white supremacist and Neo-Nazi ideologies…\n\nto attempts to rewrite history, deny the Holocaust, and rehabilitate collaborators…\n\nto rising antisemitism and other forms of religious bigotry and hatred.\n\nAt its essence, Holocaust remembrance is a call to be on constant alert.\n\nNever to be silent in the face of hate. Never tolerant of intolerance. Never indifferent to the suffering of others.\n\nAfter all, hatred does not start in a vacuum. The Nazis did not invent antisemitism, eugenics, or notions of racial supremacy.\n\nThe Holocaust was the culmination of millennia of antisemitic hate.\n\nThroughout history, the hatred that begins by declaring: “You have no right to live among us” sooner or later says: “You have no right to live.”\n\nExcellencies,\n\nThe painful truth is: antisemitism is everywhere.\n\nIn fact, it is increasing in intensity.\n\nSurvey after survey arrives at the same conclusion: antisemitism is at record-highs.\n\nAnd what is true for antisemitism is true for other forms of hate.\n\nRacism. Anti-Muslim bigotry. Xenophobia. Homophobia. Misogyny.\n\nNeo-Nazi, white supremacist movements are becoming more dangerous by the day.\n\nIn fact, they now represent the number one internal security threat in several countries – and the fastest growing.\n\nThe threat is global – and it is growing.\n\nAnd a leading accelerant of this growth is the online world.\n\nToday, I am issuing an urgent appeal to everyone with influence across the information ecosystem – regulators, policymakers, technology companies, the media, civil society, and governments.\n\nStop the hate.\n\nSet up guardrails.\n\nAnd enforce them.\n\nMany parts of the Internet are becoming toxic waste dumps for hate and vicious lies.\n\nThey are profit-driven catalysts for moving extremism from the margins to the mainstream.\n\nBy using algorithms that amplify hate to keep users glued to their screens, social media platforms are complicit. And so are the advertisers subsidising this business model.\n\nThat is why I have called for regulation that clarifies responsibility and improves transparency.\n\nWe know how easily hate speech turns to hate crime, how verbal violence breeds physical violence, how diversity and social cohesion are undermined – as are the values and principles that bind us together.\n\nThat is why I launched the United Nations Strategy and Plan of Action on Hate Speech. To provide a framework for our support to Member States to counter this scourge while respecting freedom of expression and opinion.\n\nAs part of Our Common Agenda, I have proposed a Global Digital Compact for an open, free, inclusive, and secure digital future for all, firmly anchored in human rights.\n\nI have also called for a code of conduct to promote integrity in public information – so people can make choices based on fact, not fiction.\n\nWe all have a role to play.\n\nWe can never let hate have the last word.\n\nWe cannot allow old hatreds to find new outlets and impunity on digital platforms.\n\nTogether, we must confront falsehoods with facts, ignorance with education, indifference with engagement.\n\nBecause “never again” means telling the story again and again.\n\nExcellencies,\n\nWe must remember the Holocaust not as the history of 6 million deaths; but as 6 million different stories of death.\n\nOur responsibility to honour the memory of those who perished.\n\nTo learn the truth of what happened, and to ensure that neither we, nor future generations, ever forget.\n\nTo refuse impunity for perpetrators anywhere.\n\nTo stand against those who deny, distort, relativize, revise, or otherwise whitewash their own complicities or that of their parents or grandparents with regards to the Holocaust.\n\nAnd our responsibility to intensify our efforts in prevention – to discredit prejudice, to resolve conflicts and settle disputes before they erupt.\n\nToday and every day, let us recommit to stand against evil in all its forms and work for a world of peace, human rights, and dignity for all”.\n\nThank you! Xin Cảm Ơn!"}]}

On behalf of the UN in Viet Nam, I warmly welcome you and thank you for joining us today to consult on and discuss the emerging findings of the United Nations Common Country Analysis, or CCA which will be finalized in the first quarter of 2021.\n\nIn March this year, the UN in Viet Nam initiated the Common Country Analysis process which is the UN system’s independent, impartial and collective assessment of a country’s situation for its internal use in developing the United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework, its cooperation strategy with the government. Our current such framework, or One Strategic Plan as it is known in Viet Nam, concludes on December 31st 2021 and the current CCA process therefore is to inform the next Cooperation Framework, or One Strategic Plan for the 2022 to 2026 period.\n\nThe new generation of the UN’s Common Country Analyses for different countries are intended to be living documents and a repository of impartial and independent evidence based analyses which succinctly capture a particular country’s development landscape to ensure that no one is left behind. They can, therefore, be updated as and when the situation in a country demands it and are expected to be reviewed annually.\n\nWorking towards arriving at an initial comprehensive CCA report for Viet Nam, in the last few months, the UN, under my leadership and in coordination with UN agencies operating in Viet Nam, has been compiling, distilling and consolidating information, evidence and analysis on an array of development issues in Viet Nam. Today, we will present to you our main, strategic findings thus far to obtain your feedback on them and identify areas of gaps and needs for more nuanced or better analysis. We will then take your relevant feedback, comments, ideas and suggestions into account as we formulate the final CCA report to be finalized in the first quarter of 2021. As I have indicated this will not be written in stone for the next five years, but will be reviewed, at least annually, to determine if it needs updating.\n\nIt has turned out to be particularly important and meaningful that we embarked on a Common Country Analysis this year since we are experiencing the current turbulence of a global COVID-19 pandemic. 2020 has been a tough year for the whole world. Although Viet Nam has been one of the safest countries during this time from a health perspective, many people even in Viet Nam have suffered or died and continue to do so globally due to COVID-19. Many of these individuals are people who we, as the UN, consider as being particularly vulnerable to these types of shocks and crises. In Viet Nam, despite the swift, effective and timely response from the Government, the first, second and third COVID-19 waves have undeniably left a clear footprint on Vietnamese society.\n\nIn its recovery efforts, the government and people of Viet Nam have demonstrated great resilience to the impacts of COVID-19. As reflected in the recently published joint UN report: UN Assessment on Social and Economic Impact of COVID-19 in Viet Nam that was launched in September, Viet Nam demonstrated a consistent and strong public health response. Moreover, despite the fact that Viet Nam’s economy has experienced a steep downturn due to its dependency on and the high contributions of international tourism, FDI, exports and overseas remittances which have all been negatively impacted by COVID-19, the country’s economic growth is on the rise once again, albeit at a modest pace of 2-3 per cent GDP growth in 2020, still about the best result for the Asia-Pacific region and amongst the best in the world.\n\nYet, the pandemic has forced us to re-examine the vulnerability and strengths of the country. It has also forced us to think long and hard about how to protect the most vulnerable amongst us such as women, children, the poor, the elderly, those living with disabilities and migrant workers to name just a few vulnerable population groups. How do we capitalize on the emerging mega global and other trends, comparative advantages and changing landscapes to encourage inclusive and resilient growth that equips all of us to withstand crises and shocks that are increasingly becoming a feature of our modern times? This is an important question that I believe is a critical one to consider for the future.\n\nAdvancing technology for SDG acceleration, building resilience in the health sector and capitalizing on the dynamic youth demographics are obvious low-hanging fruit that will accelerate sustainable growth for Viet Nam and its people. But it is becoming increasingly clear from the evidence that creative innovation and adaptation along with increased social investment will also be essential if Viet Nam is to both attain and sustain genuine emerging market status in the next two decades, in a manner that is inclusive and green.\n\nObserving first-hand such a fast evolving crisis unfold and supporting the Government through the WHO and other UN agencies to contain it has given the UN in Viet Nam a bird’s eye view of Viet Nam’s current and emerging strengths and future challenges. The Common Country Analysis draws on our understanding of these and, we believe, reflects the vulnerabilities that have actually materialized or been exacerbated for certain groups as a result of COVID-19. It is in this context that we are now also faced with the task of reviewing the progress made over the last five years of our One Strategic Plan (2017-2021) in our effort to identify the remaining gaps and challenges impeding the achievement of the SDGs, and Viet Nam’s wider development ambitions.\n\nLadies and Gentlemen,\n\nBefore you commence your discussions, I would like to highlight some important trends and developments from the political, economic, social and climate-related perspectives.\n\nIn 2020, Viet Nam became a crucial player on the regional and international stage. It has successfully carried out its ASEAN chairmanship this year. Viet Nam also joined the UN Security Council as a non-permanent member for the 2020-2021 term and served as the President of the Security Council in January. It will do so again in April 2021. With support from the UN, the Government of Viet Nam will host a major global Women, Peace and Security event in early December in support of its Security Council role—the only one in the Asia-Pacific—which will seek to reinforce and enhance women’s participation in peace and security in the region and beyond.\n\nThe Communist Party of Viet Nam is scheduled to hold its 13th Congress in early 2021 to elect the Party leadership for the next five years. Among other opportunities, this process presents an opportunity to progress the gender balance in the political sphere. Over the last few years, Viet Nam has secured a high participation of women in the National Assembly but as the Government has noted, there is still room for improvement.\n\nIn terms of its economic outlook, Viet Nam continues to push towards eliminating poverty, and yet gaps and discrepancies remain. Poverty remains prevalent in mountainous and ethnic minority areas and the COVID-19 pandemic has not helped matters. Millions of people have lost their jobs and income, especially those in the “missing middle” and on the breadline and those reliant on informal sources of income. And recovery, although relatively buoyant in some sectors, is heavily concentrated in specific sectors. It is expected that this recovery will take some time to trickle down to those on the margins, those living in rural areas and those disenfranchised by chronic poverty.\n\nLooking at social development, Viet Nam has also observed remarkable social improvements accompanied by a significant demographic transformation. Improvements in health and education have been notable and allowed more people to access basic services for a better quality of life, regardless of wealth. However, again, there exist barriers resulting in patchy access to inclusive social services and general well-being, most notably nutrition, water, sanitation and hygiene, health, social protection, elderly care and education.\n\nColleagues,\n\nViet Nam is recognized as one of the world’s ten most vulnerable countries to climate change. The recent storm and floods have been devastating and have reinforced the urgent need to strengthen the country’s climate resilience. Besides extreme weather events, saltwater intrusion in the Mekong Delta region, the management of natural resources such as land and soil as well as waste and pollution are emerging areas which will require huge sums of money and commitment to resolve, not only to preserve the country’s precious biodiversity for future generations, but also for the preservation of human lives, here and now.\n\nAs I indicated earlier in these remarks, the Common Country Analysis requires independence and impartiality but should be evidence-driven. And this is where your presence today provides value-addition as we begin refining, expanding and strengthening the analysis and finalizing the 2021 Viet Nam Common Country Analysis (CCA) report. Today we seek your insights, perspectives and expertise to examine key issues in four focus areas – people-centered social development; economic transformation, environment and climate change, and governance and justice. We also invite your views on critical cross-cutting issues including gender equality, youth, and partnerships as well as the assessment of Viet Nam’s commitments to international norms and standards. Finally, we request your insights on cross-boundary and regional issues as well as financing for development.\n\nToday’s consultation is a unique multi-stakeholder platform organized by the UN with high commitment to leaving no one behind in the journey towards achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals in Viet Nam by 2030. As I mentioned at the beginning, your thoughts, ideas, comments and inputs will contribute to shaping a useful CCA that captures the experiences and trends that you have encountered in both your life and your area of work. On behalf of the UN, I invite you to support the improvement of our initial analysis to ensure a CCA that is fit-for-purpose and which best reflects the realities of the citizens of Viet Nam and people on the ground.\n\nAgain, I welcome you and wish you a fruitful and successful consultation today.\n\nThank you! Xin cảm ơn!"}]}

GEL and National Strategy on Gender Equality + gender sensitive provisions in various other laws such as the Labour Code\n\nHowever, implementation has not been optimal and significant gaps remain.\n\nTake for example your labour and employment policies. Despite global integration of the Vietnamese economy leading to growth in job opportunities for women, decent work is not yet a reality for most. Wage employment accounts for less than 1/3 of total female labour, in comparison with 40% of men. And, direct discrimination against women such as the different retirement age between women and men or discriminatory practices by employers based on maternity and pregnancy remain unresolved. The Global Gender Gap Index Report suggests that the wage gap between women and men has been increasing, contrary to the global trend.\n\nIf we look at violence against women, as many as 3 out of 5 women in Viet Nam experience at least one form of violence by their partners at some point in their lives. Although you have a law against DV that stipulates that adequate protection and support services and channels to seek justice should be available to women, only 1 in 10 has sought help from the authorities. This may be because there are hardly any shelters services available for women, or adequate investment has not been made to train law enforcement of social workers to handle DV cases with sensitivity and respect for the rights of the victims. This lack of investment has an economic cost. In a study that UN Women conducted with Institute of Family and Gender Studies, we found that the direct cost and the lost opportunity cost due to DV combined amounted to 3% of the GDP. This is not an insignificant amount.\n\nAnd we all know that the situation is further exacerbated if you are an ethnic minority women or girl. There are very few job training opportunities available to ethnic minority women or social services are further removed from you because of your ethnicity, your gender, your remoteness, language, etc. etc.\n\nGovernments reflect their priorities in how they spend their money. If a policy commitment is not supported by a specific budget allocation, by implication the government is announcing a low priority on the achievement of that policy. Where does gender equality and women's empowerment in ethnic minority areas stand in this context? Is there a policy commitment? And are adequate budgets allocated?\n\nOne of the effective ways to overcoming challenges to promote gender equality is gender responsive budgeting (GRB), which refers to a variety of processes and tools aimed at facilitating an assessment of the gendered impacts of government budgets.\n\nTo date, UN Women has supported more than 90 countries with various GRB initiatives, including Viet Nam. In the context of Viet Nam, with the 2015 State Budget Law that added gender equality principle for state budget expenditure and planning, we have an entry point to demand better attention to gender equality impact when government is making investment and budget allocation decisions.\n\nKey to realizing this commitment is that the policy process is participatory and that the analysis moves beyond budget allocations, to review implementation of the budget at the ground level. Globally CSOs play a critical role in this process and social accountability tools have been developed and used to monitor various stages of public expenditure for gender responsive budgeting work. In India, Malaysia and Philippines, gender responsive budgeting has been used effectively by CSO to strengthen state accountability towards gender equality and the empowerment of women. In India, for example, CSO groups have for year now been analyzing budgets for specific groups of women such as those in the Dalit and Adivasi communities, also known as the untouchable caste and tribal groups. It is shocking to calculate that the total allocation for Dalit-Adivasi women forms a meagre 0.99% of the total Gender Budget Statement.\n\nSome of these tools will be shared and discussed with you in the next two days, such as social audit, citizen report card (CRCs), community score card, engendering Budget Call Circular and Budget Statement, Participatory Budgeting.\n\nIn the past few years, UN Women's advocacy and capacity on gender responsive budgeting has been focusing on the government and this is the first time that we have organized a workshop with CSO partners on this particular subject. I see that many of you are positioning yourselves as a trusted advisor and an essential partner of the government that brings the voice from the ground into policy making, and I hope that the workshop will trigger some new ideas for your important work.\n\nIn closing, I want to thank the Government of Ireland for its support which has enabled us to be here today, CEPEW and iSee for working with us to prepare this workshop, and the resource persons that are taking their time to be with us over the next two days.\n\nThank you for your attention and I wish you all happiness and good health."}]}

He has asked that I convey his warm greetings and regrets for not being here. Allow me now to read the Resident Coordinator's message.\n\nIn opening, I would like to express my appreciation to MOFA for hosting this consultation, and on the side of the UN in Viet Nam, the financial and substantive support of UNDP in making this event happen.\n\nThe UN Country Team believes the UPR process to be an invaluable opportunity for the Government of Viet Nam to engage directly with people, receive guidance from other UN members states, reflect internally on Government policy and practice, and develop new measures, all with the objective of strengthening human rights protection in Viet Nam.\n\nThe Third Cycle Review presents us with certain unique opportunities.\n\nFirstly, we can track human rights trends since the first review in 2009, analyzing recommendations on human rights made by other countries, and how these recommendations have been implemented, or are yet to be implemented.\n\nSecondly, with Viet Nam demonstrating greater capacity in managing the UPR process, through the continued strong coordination of MOFA, the Third Cycle allows us to focus more on the substantive human rights issues raised under the review. We encourage MOFA and all Ministries to see the UPR as an opportunity to work with stakeholders to develop practical steps to promote human rights, which will facilitate an even more in depth and effective review in 4 years time.\n\nSince the last review, the UN in Viet Nam wishes to commend the Government for progress achieved in the protection of human rights. We have seen advancements in the protection of the rights of LGBT persons, the provision of social security for vulnerable groups, and reforms in the criminal justice system.\n\nWe must also recognize progress made by Viet Nam in furthering international integration in the area of human rights, including the ratification of both the Convention against Torture, and the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.\n\nWe welcome the visit to Viet Nam of the UN Special Rapporteurs on Freedom of Religion or Belief and the Right to Food. Viet Nam is also currently preparing to be reviewed under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights for the first time since 2002, and under the Convention against Torture for the first time.\n\nSuch progress complements the UPR process by highlighting gaps between human rights policy and practice. The UN in Viet Nam are delighted to have been in a position to support these achievements, and look forward to continue working with the Government and other stakeholders toward even greater integration over the next 4 years.\n\nWe also know that the UPR provides us with an opportunity to examine human rights challenges, which every country experiences. Viet Nam is no different and we know both in recent years, and as we look ahead, there are challenges faced by the country.\n\nThrough the work of the UN in Viet Nam, UN reporting mechanisms and special procedures of the Human Rights Council, we recognize the negative impacts on human rights of increased environmental degradation, and the consequences of failing to hold business enterprises accountable for human rights abuses.\n\nKey to addressing these challenges is building partnerships, working with businesses, individuals and organizations for the promotion of human rights. We must create an environment which encourages different groups to come together.\n\nThe United Nations in Viet Nam is committed to constructive engagement with the government of Viet Nam to foster an environment that provides an enabling space for engagement of partners in the wider civil society.\n\nWith over 400 UPR country reviews conducted, the UN recognizes the critical importance of engagement with those who advocate for the protection of human rights to help reflect the voices of people and communities throughout this process, particularly those most marginalized in society. We warmly welcome MOFA's decision to co-host this consultation, and hope this commitment to greater engagement and participation continues throughout this process and beyond.\n\nLooking ahead, the UN would like to highlight three key messages on our respective roles in this important process.\n\nFirstly, we must all rethink our understanding of partnerships in human rights. We know the impact the private sector can have on human rights, both positive and negative, and we must explore appropriate opportunities to work with business to promote respect for human rights. Also, through Industrial Revolution 4.0, with machine learning and enhanced automation, we must reach out to technology leaders and responsible Government agencies to ensure innovations strengthen human rights and don't leave people behind.\n\nSecondly, as development partners and organizations, with Viet Nam moving into middle income status and reduced inflows of overseas aid, we must reassess our role in assisting the Government. It is critical that we support by connecting Government to international experiences, expertise and partnerships as the country continues to develop its capacity to protect, respect and fulfil its human rights obligations.\n\nThirdly, all stakeholders play a key role in monitoring the human rights situation in Viet Nam. International experience shows that a vibrant community of civic organizations can provide the Government with key partners in giving a voice to vulnerable groups, highlighting risks and areas of concern, and working constructively with agencies to strengthen the protection of human rights. We must all look to support this engagement and ensure the full potential of Government engagement with the public is realized.\n\nThe UN in Viet Nam, we believe, plays a critical convening role. Through our strong national partnerships and international knowledge network, we provide a space for stakeholders to engage with each other and explore ways to address the most pressing human rights challenges, and we believe co-organizing this consultation is a strong example of this role.\n\nLadies and Gentlemen,\n\nAllow me to conclude by saying that the UN Resident Coordinator in Viet Nam wanted to take this opportunity to reiterate the UN Country Team's commitment, as a longstanding partner of the Government of Viet Nam, to continuing our support to your Excellency's Government and the people of Vietnam, supporting the country's continued engagement with this invaluable global mechanism to help protect, promote and fulfill the rights of everyone in Viet Nam.\n\nThank You, Xin Cảm Ơn!"}]}

Testing always helps and it saves lives. The earlier the test and, if needed the treatment, the better to stay healthy and productive and in addition, contribute to stopping the virus from spreading further. And if the test is HIV negative, it is a way to learn about HIV and prevention but also about other health issues and seek treatment for those as needed.\n\nIn 2018, Viet Nam has kept its promise again and turned commitment into action on HIV with much progress towards achieving the 90-90-90 targets by 2020.\n\nThe national AIDS response is on the eve of making another historic step as for the first time HIV treatment will be provided and reimbursed by the Social Health Insurance (SHI) from January 2019 and a high number of People Living with HIV (PLHIV) on HIV treatment benefit from SHI with integrated health benefits well beyond HIV. I wish to sincerely appreciate all the intense work done by the Viet Nam Authority for HIV/AIDS Control (VAAC), other colleagues from the Ministry of Health, Viet Nam Social Security, Provincial AIDS Committees (PAC) and Centers for Disease Control (CDC), heath facilities and the PLHIV community with dedicated support from development partners to prepare for this major transition towards sustainable quality and affordable treatment as part of universal health access.\n\nThis year, we are also celebrating the 10 years of the Methadone Maintenance Therapy (MMT) programme which has been very successful and effective to reduce new infections among People Who Inject Drugs (PWID), allow many people to enjoy a more stable and safe life and contribute to society. It has been a major pillar of the national AIDS response and its impact so far is impressive. We look forward to discussions on how to further expand it with more innovative approaches and complement it with interventions to address Amphetamine-type stimulants (ATS) use with a human rights-based approach.\n\nThis year again, many innovative approaches have successfully embraced and are now expanding bringing more options for people to more easily access friendly HIV services including community-based testing, self- testing, Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP), more flexible services for MMT, needle & syringes, viral load and support for a zero stigmatization and zero discrimination environment.\n\nIndeed, against a smart virus and with only 2 years left to go to achieve the committed national and global targets by 2020 and 12 years to the 2030 Goal of ending AIDS, we cannot afford any complacency or losing time.\n\nMany challenges remain in terms of rising new infections among some populations, gaps in and need to revitalize prevention which remains key to achieve the end of AIDS and transition to SHI and into the general health system as part of Universal Health Coverage while human resources dedicated to HIV are shrinking. Many people, including those behind bars, still lack access to HIV services and face stigma and discrimination. However, we know, from almost 30 years, that strong political commitment, leadership, targeted investments, a conducive legal and policy framework and a strong partnership makes an enormous difference and impact.\n\nLet's continue keeping the promise and turn them into action, in Ho Chi Minh City and in every province and city in Viet Nam even in areas where HIV may seem low but need to be kept under control to avoid it bouncing back. With sufficient and timely domestic and external investments in the right combination of interventions supported by legal framework that enables communities in need to access the services, let's keep Viet Nam on the right track towards the 90-90-90 and ending AIDS.\n\nOn this World AIDS Day, we give a special thought to all the people lost to AIDS in Viet Nam and worldwide. We also appreciate the long and new champions, young and less young, all across Viet Nam who work really hard to protect others from HIV, provide quality treatment, care and support and stand up to reduce stigma and discrimination. With everyone's contribution, we can leave no one behind!\n\nDeputy Prime Minister Vu Duc Dam has urged us on other occasions to \"achieve the 90-90-90 targets, with 100-100-100% commitment and even more\". Let us continue Viet Nam's strong tradition of solidarity and keep our promise to achieve the 90-90-90 target, towards ending AIDS by 2030.\n\nViet Nam Vo dich!\n\nXin cam on va chuc suc khoe!"}]}

Mr. Dao Ngoc Dung, Minister of Labour, Invalids and Social Affairs\n\nRepresentatives from line ministries and provinces\n\nAmbassadors and representatives of the diplomatic community\n\nRepresentatives from NGOs, other development partners and community-based organizations\n\nLeaders and staff of VietnamAirlines\n\nRepresentatives from the private sector\n\nMedia Representatives\n\nDistinguished guests\n\nIt is an honor to join His Excellency Minister to welcome you at this launching ceremony of the 2023 National Action Month on Gender Equality and Gender-Based Violence Prevention and Response. This is the 8th year of a joint UN  - Government of Viet Nam collaboration for National Action Month.\n\nThe global 16 Days of Activism which runs from 25 November,  the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women, and ends on 10 December, Human Rights Day are a reminder that violence against women and girls is a grave violation of human rights.\n\nThis year, the UNiTE campaign theme isInvest to Prevent Violence Against Women & Girls.The theme emphasizes the importance of financing the prevention of violence.\n\nGlobally, it is estimated that implementing prevention and treatment programmes to end gender based violence in 132 target low and middle income countries by 2030 will cost 42 billion USD.\n\nAccording to the National Study on Violence Against Women in Viet Nam 20191, violence against women is costing Vietnam an estimated 1.8 per cent of GDP per year (2018). The costs associated with living with violence, such as health care, legal services, and lost income, as well as productivity loss as a result of reduced work performance and absenteeism – account for close to 2% of the country’s GDP.\n\nThe study also estimated that the earnings of women who experience violence may be 35 per cent less than those not abused.\n\nThis is an extraordinarily high price to pay.\n\nIn response, Viet Nam has adopted a comprehensiveProgramme on Elimination of Violence against Women and Children (EVAWC)(2021-2025) with the cooperation of the Australian government and the UN.Through this programme, which builds on previous investments by other partners such as Japan and Korea, the UN has supported the roll out of evidence-based  strategies to reduce the incidence of violence against women and children within the home and in public spaces.\n\nA comprehensive framework on prevention of violence against women called RESPECT and on prevention of children, called INSPIRE - Globally, these evidence-based strategies have demonstrated positive results which provides member states, development partners and the private sector strong options for investments.\n\nAnd here in Viet Nam, these partnerships have established the first few One-Stop Service Centres putting the survivor at the centre of a network of support. Investments in these services are crucial and I know through cooperation with several UN agencies, more provinces are adopting these centres.\n\nWe know that COVID-19, climate change induced disasters and conflicts all increase the rates of gender based violence and exacerbate economic hardship for households. These are threats that continue to loom over us. To mitigate the impacts of such crises, investing in prevention is not only better for women, children and households, but it is better for the economy.\n\nExcellency Minister, it is worth highlighting that sustainable financing of:\n\nwill help sustain the progress we are making in eliminating violence against women and children.\n\nSadly, around the world, less than 0.002 percent of global Official Development Assistance is directed to gender-based violence prevention, and that funding is often poor quality, short-term and sporadic. Few national governments have transformative GBV prevention policies, nor are budgets well-aligned with prevention strategies and interventions.[1]More partnerships are required to raise the resources to enable a whole of society response.\n\nI therefore commend Vietnam Airlines for taking the lead in investing resources to join the collective efforts to promote gender equality. Through these investments, Vietnam Airlines is taking big strides to make the aviation sector an equal and friendly working environment for women. Firstly, Vietnam Airlines’ decision to sign up to theUN Women Global Women’s Empowerment Principlesdemonstrates its commitment to ensure that company policies and practice will not condone violence against women and children, sexual exploitation or sexual harassment.\n\nSecondly, Vietnam Airlines’ commitment today is a testament to ‘Invest in prevention,’ as the company takes measures to promote women-owned businesses as one critical pathway to women’s economic empowerment and the prevention of gender based violence.\n\nThis action month, I call upon private sector companies to follow this lead and invest more in the prevention of violence against women and children.\n\nAs we embark on yet another season of festivities during this National Action Month, I want to inspire you with 5 actions you too can invest in at an individual level,\n\nLet’s UNITE – for a better and equal planet for our children and the next generations to come.\n\nI wish you all a very successful and meaningful National Action Month this year!\n\nThank you!

Viet Nam has made significant progress towards integrating the Warsaw Framework for REDD+ into its new National REDD+ Action Programme in 2017, as well as incorporating lessons learned from implementation in pilot provinces. Viet Nam has mobilized high-level political support around its multi-sectoral vision for REDD+ and green development. I furthermore would like to congratulate the Government of Viet Nam for being in the forefront of reducing CO2, as it is among the most experienced countries globally to have pioneered REDD+ readiness and demonstration. Continued strong national ownership and support of REDD+ activities beyond the UN-REDD Programme in 2018 are now needed to maintain the current momentum.\n\nThere is also a need for transformation in the way Viet Nam values and organizes protection of its forests. Full forest values must be factored into national planning processes and mechanisms, and integrated into the national development agenda and its associated priorities. Building on the close partnership with the UN Country Team in the country, Viet Nam has made commendable progress in promoting more effective and multi-sectoral approaches to tackling deforestation. Directive 13 from the Party, the endorsement of the new National REDD+ Action Plan and the Target Programme on Sustainable Forest Development, together with the signature of the national agreement on Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade with the European Union, and the increased involvement of the private sector and local communities all converge to create a solid platform for transformation and progress, putting Viet Nam at the global forefront of sustainable forest management and protection.\n\nBuilding on the words of my fellow colleagues, I would like to emphasize two key messages. First, a major transformation will be required to build an enabling environment for domestic and international businesses to thrive in and benefit from investing in sustainable natural forest developments. Past testimonies of private sector leaders have demonstrated that it is possible, but also that it will require a high level of ingenuity and face many indirect costs. The Government of Viet Nam and committed international and national partners will need to focus their attention on innovating and piloting new business models to build favourable conditions for success and upscaling. The recommendations provided today by colleagues and experts from MARD, MPI and MOF offer relevant scope and platform to engage the change. I encourage all stakeholders, including private sector organizations and representatives, to take the time and share valuable insights to help complete this exercise in a timely manner.\n\nI acknowledge that implementing these solutions will take time and require a shift in mindset, and today’s discussions and statements have underlined that we still have a long way to go. Enterprises are calling for increased transparency and higher social and environmental standards to be enforced and we will need to find solutions that will allow smarter regulations to protect actors whose actions benefit society and who build value for the people and the environment instead of destroying it. Robust and strong partnerships must be built to take on the challenge to design such “smart regulations” and encourage businesses to invest in sustainable development of natural forests. The Government of Viet Nam will need to play a leading role and show the way for everyone else through concrete implementation, while making bold and courageous decisions. The private sector will also need to play its role as they have a critical social responsibility in raising awareness on opportunities and challenges of doing business in an era of climate change and a shift to more sustainable development. Flagship experience should be disseminated and inspire others, and allow the construction of new markets and opportunities, and support entrepreneurs at various stages of their development from start-up to when their businesses mature. This will require to connect needs with solutions, and mobilize a dynamic landscape of service providers to backstop forest business leaders.\n\nSecondly, I would like to emphasize that the UN will remains an important strategic and committed partner of the Government of Viet Nam to further strengthen the sustainable management of forests in collaboration with the domestic and international business sector to achieve mutual benefits. This endeavour will require assembling and connecting partners and initiatives in different areas of expertise, a coordination task playing to the comparative strengths of the UN. Various UN agencies in Viet Nam are providing continued support to relevant ministries and National Assembly committees on existing legislation as well as the formulation of both new broad and more specific legal reforms in areas relevant to forests, land, planning, investment and business.\n\nThe UN-REDD Programme, jointly convened by FAO, UNDP and UN Environment and active in Viet Nam since 2009, has developed valuable partnerships with leading business companies and associations to pilot the implementation of social and environmental standards in programs related to forests, an initiative that is one of a kind. In addition, UN-REDD has longstanding experience in partnering with international and national organizations, including research centres, NGOs, and bilateral cooperation agencies to build a basis of knowledge and experience, and to connect key business players to find new and innovative solutions for supporting their development.\n\nLadies and Gentlemen,The UN in Viet Nam, including the REDD+ leading agencies, i.e. FAO, UNDP and UN Envir6onment, as well as other UN agencies such as UNIDO, have a long-term commitment to their partnership with the Government, and are fully supportive of the agenda of realizing economic opportunities for sustainable management of natural forests through engagement and empowerment of the business sector.\n\nOn behalf of the UN in Viet Nam, I would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to cooperate closely with the Government of Viet Nam, the Government of the Kingdom of Norway, the private sector and other related partners to accelerate progress towards achieving more sustainable management of natural forests under the REDD+ framework, and in realizing Viet Nam’s ambitious development goals.\n\nXin Cảm Ơn!"}]}

This event marks very successful completion of the two-year hard-working preparation for the Census from the central to commune levels, particularly members of the Census Steering Committees, including Ha Noi Census Steering Committees, General Statistics Office and its local branches, and more than 130 thousand enumerators, team leaders, and supervisors. I am so happy to see some of you are here today. So a BIG CONGRATULTION to you all!\n\nLadies and gentlemen,\n\nCensus is no doubt the largest survey that a country has. It collects important information from all the households in the country. This 2019 Census will provide key information on population and housing, allowing us to see population changes in the last decade, covering many areas including population size and structure, fertility, mortality, migration, education, employment, disability, and housing conditions. This huge data set is a vital information source for the development, monitoring and evaluation of various socio-economic policies, strategies, and development plans at national, sub-national and sectoral levels as well as for the monitoring of the Sustainable Development Goals and targets in Viet Nam.\n\nIndeed, the quality of data depends heavily on the how the data are collected. Therefore, the role of data enumerators and supervisors is crucial in ensuring accuracy and reliability of information collected. I trust that with your experience, knowledge and skills obtained from the training, and particularly your strong commitment, the Census will be conducted with huge success.\n\nI would like to stress another very important thing: This 2019 Population and Housing Census is the first-ever Census in Viet Nam that applies the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in all of its phases. The use of smart phones and tablets or web-based form for data enumeration is one of many \"data revolutions\" in the context of the Industry 4.0. The adoption of new technology in Census will substantially improve the quality and transparency of data collected, shorten the time for data processing and early disseminate results for Census data users, especially policy makers for decision making at national and subnational levels. Across the world, some countries are leading this global trend, and Viet Nam is now joining them. I am sure we all feel very proud to be part of this revolutionary move, led by the GSO. Congratulations, Mr. Lam, and all the GSO colleagues. Congratulations to you all!\n\nLadies and gentlemen,\n\nUNFPA has a long history of successful cooperation with the GSO in undertaking population and housing Censuses, starting with the very first Census in 1979. We are very proud of our contributions to the success of all the Census conducted over the last four decades, as well as to the growth of the national statistical capacities in producing this very critical data, and other population-based surveys. Within the current framework of UNFPA Country Programme Document (CPD) for the period 2017-2021, UNFPA commits to support the GSO in not only carrying out this Census successfully, but also in producing and disseminating Census results. Producing and making good use of quality Census data, we can make a difference for better lives of all the people, and make sure to \"leave no one behind\".\n\nI would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute in advance to the dedication and professionalism of all those involved who I know will be working very hard over the next months to make sure that the 2019 census is a success.\n\nI wish you all very good health and happiness.\n\nLet's make this Census a monumental success!\n\nThank you very much"}]}

Human Rights Day is observed on 10 December each year, the day the Universal Declaration of Human Rights was adopted in 1948. 74 years on, we continue to reaffirm the promise of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights – to uphold universal, indivisible and inalienable rights and fundamental freedoms for everyone, everywhere.\n\nTo remind us of the relevance and legacy of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and ahead of its 75th Anniversary celebration next year, the United Nations is launching the year-long campaign “UDHR 75: Dignity, Freedom and Justice for All”.\n\nToday, the world is facing a multitude of challenges, from pandemics to conflicts to climate change. Across the globe, social injustice pervades societies; fundamental freedoms of religion and belief, of opinion and expression, are under attack; and marginalized groups face persistent inequalities and discrimination, unable to exercise their rights.\n\nIn Viet Nam, we have also seen many challenges this year, including recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic, coping with the increasing food and energy prices from the fallout of the war in Ukraine, and battling the impact of the climate crisis at the frontlines. As one of the countries most affected by the climate crisis, the General Assembly Resolution on the right to a clean and healthy environment adopted this year is particularly relevant in the Vietnamese context. It is ultimately the vulnerable populations who disproportionately bear the brunt of these stresses to social, political, and economic systems.\n\nWe think about the women who face increased risks of gender-based violence and burdens for unpaid care and domestic work in times of crises. We think about the children in rural areas who are even more susceptible to severe malnourishment when food becomes scarcer. We think about the smallholder farmers whose crop yields are destroyed by drought, heat waves and flooding.\n\nSuch challenges threaten dignity and equality in rights, including health, food, education, an adequate standard of living, social assistance, and even to life itself. The realities that vulnerable individuals and communities face in their lives and livelihoods serve as a reminder and push for our continued action to integrate human rights in all development priorities – from climate action, to social protection, to economic transformation – and put people at the centre of development.\n\nDistinguished guests,\n\nI would once again like to congratulate the Government of Viet Nam on its election to the Human Rights Council for the period 2023-2025. With membership to the Human Rights Council comes a great responsibility but also an important opportunity to demonstrate concrete efforts in protecting and promoting economic, social, cultural, civil, and political rights in line with international human rights standards and the human rights treaties that Viet Nam has ratified.\n\nIn this regard, international human rights mechanisms, such as the UPR, are important avenues for honest reflection and constructive dialogue on human rights between the human rights treaty bodies, Government, state entities, civil society, businesses, development partners, and other key actors.\n\nAs Viet Nam launches the 4th Cycle of the UPR, I would like to share two points to guide the process:\n\nFirst, embrace the UPR as a way to reflect on and improve human rights progress in the country. In the 3rd Cycle of the UPR, Viet Nam fully supported 220 out of 291 recommendations it received, an increase of 13% from the 2nd Cycle. This positive trend is encouraging and should continue in the 4th Cycle. But beyond the acceptance of recommendations, allow me to stress the importance of implementing these recommendations, and to do so in complementarity with those from other international human rights mechanisms such as Treaty Bodies and Special Procedures.\n\nSecond, ensure inclusion and participation throughout the UPR process. I would like to stress the importance of increased and meaningful engagement of diverse non-government actors and communities, including children, youth, women, the elderly, ethnic minorities, LGBTI persons, persons with disabilities, and other vulnerable populations. We believe that, to achieve the SDGs by 2030 and also the commitments made at the COP 26 last year, Viet Nam needs to unlock the full potential of a whole-of-society approach. Listening to their voices and promoting vibrant dialogue across many segments of the society can help Viet Nam progress on a broad range of issues. The same approach should be taken in the next UPR process as well. This entails empowering rights holders with the knowledge, networks and access to justice to claim their rights individually and collectively. The crucial role and value of civil society and communities in adding expertise and experience from the realities on the ground, cannot be stressed enough.\n\nDistinguished guests,\n\nThe United Nations is proud to be a long-standing partner of Viet Nam over the past 45 years. We were privileged to welcome our Secretary-General to Viet Nam in October, who was able to commemorate this anniversary in person along with the leadership and people of Viet Nam.  As we step into the new year, the UN in Viet Nam will continue to work closely with the Government of Viet Nam, development partners and civil society, to keep human rights at the centre of all development efforts.\n\nAs One UN, based on the UN Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework for 2022-2026 and drawing on our different expertise, we will support Viet Nam in capacity building, multi-stakeholder consultations and other technical assistance, to respect, protect, promote and fulfil all human rights. This will be done in close collaboration with the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, the key agency for human rights within the United Nations.\n\nI am hopeful that stronger collaboration and cooperation, coupled with the positive momentum as we look towards Viet Nam’s upcoming membership in the Human Rights Council, will create a more inclusive society in Viet Nam, which upholds dignity, freedom, and justice for all.\n\nThank you! Xin cam on!"}]}

The global report stresses that AIDS is not over and still a very serious epidemic and the importance of focusing on the right people, right location based on evidence, in a timely and innovative manner, widening the range of options for prevention, HIV testing and bringing user-friendly and quality services where they are most needed.\n\nIn the Asia Pacific region, a fast target was set of no more than 90,000 new HIV infections by 2020 which is only 2,5 years from now. Despite significant progress, the actual estimated trend indicates the region will still have about 290,000 new infections by 2020 - or 200,000 more than the target. In other words, we all need to redouble efforts to accelerate progress to meet the targets. Here in Viet Nam, the epidemic remains a serious public health threat. This is why Viet Nam remains among the special fast track countries for UNAIDS as well as PEPFAR and the GFATM. More than ever, political and financial commitments at all levels remain essential.\n\nAs we reflect on progress, it is always good to look back at past impact. A recent UN-supported impact analysis developed with VAAC estimates that between 2001 and 2016, nearly a half million infections were averted, a significant portion of which were due to the expansion of the HIV response in Viet Nam from the mid-2000s until now. Efforts and investments are paying off and need to now adapt to the evolving situation in terms of the epidemic's evolution, available innovative interventions as well as financial and human resources constraints and opportunities.\n\nWe now have better data including sub national estimates of the epidemic and gaps in the response showing a great diversity across provinces. Cross sharing and learning what is working the best to reduce the gaps is one of the benefits of this meeting.\n\nAlso, the latest data from Viet Nam indicate new infections among sex workers and people who inject drugs have declined thanks to effective programmes but there remains a need to also focus on partners of key populations and men who have sex with men. These groups increasingly benefit from some specific interventions which are promising if targeted efforts are sustained. Prevention including condoms, behaviour change counselling, but also needle and syringe and OSP remains essential and a good investment – we will need to find ways to sustain those efforts which are key to reduce new infections.\n\nTreatment scale up also remains a priority both to save lives and reduce HIV transmission. Thanks to strong political commitment, a bold decision was made to ensure 100% health insurance coverage for people living with HIV and impressive progress has been made thanks to quick mobilization at all levels and especially at the local level. Social health insurance for people living with HIV becomes vital to sustain the delivery of HIV treatment services but also facilitates access to other health services and offers more sustainable financing for facilities. This is a complex transition and good communication at all level and with the community and especially patients is important. As done in some provinces already, finding solutions for some groups of people living with HIV who may face additional challenges to register for health insurance due to poverty or marginalization will ensure no people living with HIV miss ART and none is left behind. This transition to health insurance is seen regionally and globally as a very interesting and inspiring development and experience that can be useful for other countries in terms of service integration and a step towards financial sustainability. We very much look forward to update and discussion, lessons learned and solutions found in this meeting as well as how Development Partners can further support this transition.\n\nThe various innovations that are being introduced or piloted in Viet Nam such as for community and lay testing, self-testing, PrEP, differentiate treatment are also promising as widening the options for people to protect themselves from HIV, know their HIV status and enrol in and adhere to ART over time is what works best to fast track progress. We hope the successful lessons learned from those regular interventions and pilots will be put to scale to optimize their full potential in the coming years\n\nA number of challenges and concerns but also solutions, renewed hopes and commitments are emerging to achieve our national goals. More than ever, at a time of complex transition and less external resources, effective coordination and further strengthening efficiency are essential to optimize the precious human and financial resources at all levels.\n\nIn terms of the broader political commitment and enabling environment, the National Assembly's support the national response through updating some key legal and policy framework (i.e. Law on HIV, Law on Drugs and Ordnance on Sex work) is a good opportunity to institutionalize new effective approaches and ensure sufficient resources at central, provincial and local levels.\n\nDevelopment Partners are committed to support national leadership and well-coordinated planning and reporting led by VAAC with all stakeholders, including partners, aligned around one plan at national and provincial level. Increasingly, resources will come from the national budget, including health insurance, so ensuring efficiencies through reducing any fragmentation and optimizing the use of available resources across the complementary projects supporting the national response is crucial. Conditions for the use of funds are also now stricter with for example unspent GFATM funds which could be lost for Viet Nam. If we do not coordinate well to maximize impact, we may continue to face some gaps for people who need HIV services, risk losing some of the gains especially during this transition time and not be able to reach the 90-90-90 and national goal for harm reduction. Missing that would imply even more complex and costly HIV response later. We hope to hear from you how we can work together for and support more effective coordination at provincial and national level.\n\nDevelopment Partners are proud to have contributed to the achieved progress and we know that, with continued strong national leadership and partnership, Viet Nam is well on the way to reach the 90-90-90. The Development Partners reiterate their strong support to the national programme and, in particular, for technical guidance and policy development, strategic information, innovative approaches, guiding service delivery, capacity building, working with communities and achieving more efficiency gains through effective coordination.\n\nTogether, let's focus on facilitating solutions - from planning and quantification to service delivery - from HIV prevention to ART adherence and viral load suppression in a sustainable manner.\n\nWe look forward to hearing the update and discussion especially with the provinces who are at the forefront, delivering services to the people who need them, with the MOH and VAAC precious guidance.\n\nThank you very much!"}]}

It is my honor and privilege to mark the first of many commemorations of the 78th anniversary of the founding of the United Nations here with you on the occasion of IFAD’s 30th anniversary in Viet Nam. This morning we congratulate and appreciate the fruitful collaboration between IFAD, the UN system, ministries, government agencies, provincial authorities, mass organizations, and other stakeholders.\n\nIFAD's unwavering focus to fighting poverty and hunger has made a significant impact on rural communities, especially the ethnic minority groups in Viet Nam. How has IFAD done this? By facilitating greater participation of ethnic minority groups in the identification and prioritization of their needs as the basis for developing relevant response actions, IFAD has empowered farmers, women, and young people, helping them overcome challenges and achieve sustainable development.\n\nThe collaboration between the Government of Viet Nam, the UN including IFAD, together with development and private actors has played a crucial role in driving positive change in the country. By combining our knowledge, resources, and networks, we have effectively addressed the complex challenges faced by rural populations. Together, we have created synergies that maximize our impact and deliver meaningful results.\n\nLast month, the SDG Summit took place in New York, where the Prime Minister of Viet Nam announced the country's national commitments to SDG acceleration.  These commitments align with the global SDG actions recommended for transformations in (1) food systems; (2) energy access and affordability; (3) digital connectivity; (4) education; (5) jobs and social protection; and (6) climate change and biodiversity loss.\n\nFollowing the SDG Summit, and looking ahead, three areas where we can strengthen our collaboration to benefit rural communities in Viet Nam.\n\nFirst and foremost, we must harness the potential of digital technologies and innovation to promote inclusive and sustainable agriculture. By embracing technology, we can empower small-scale farmers, boost productivity, and improve market access. Let us work together to ensure that digital tools and knowledge are accessible to all, reaching the unreached including young people, women, farmers, especially ethnic minority groups unlocking their potential to drive agricultural progress.\n\nSecond, as we tackle the urgent issue of climate change, IFAD's expertise in climate-smart agriculture becomes increasingly vital. By integrating climate resilience into farming practices, we will safeguard food security, preserve the environment, and build resilient communities. Let us prioritize the involvement of youth groups in climate action and empower them to be agents of change, securing their future and that of the next generations.\n\nThird, we must continue to prioritize gender equality and women's empowerment. IFAD remains a strong advocate for recognizing the crucial role of women in rural development. By ensuring equal access to resources, knowledge, and representation for women and young people, we unlock their potential and accelerate progress. Let us work collectively to create an enabling environment that promotes women's economic empowerment and leadership in rural areas.\n\nAs we celebrate 30 years of IFAD's transformative work in Viet Nam, we acknowledge that challenges remain.\n\nAs the UN, we believe that –\n\nTogether, we can overcome these challenges.\n\nTogether, we can build an inclusive future where no one is left behind.\n\nTogether, we can ensure that young people, women, and farmers lead the way in our journey of progress.\n\nThank you!"}]}

This is our 9th year. We especially appreciate the support of the Government of Australia under the joint programme on Elimination of Violence Against Women and Children in Viet Nam 2021-2025.\n\nViet Nam’s national action month coincides with the global 16 Days of Activism, which runs from 25 November, the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women, to 10 December, Human Rights Day. These dates serve as a powerful reminder that violence against women and girls is a grave violation of human rights. It reminds us of the essential collective action needed to eradicate it.\n\nViet Nam has a strong legal framework in place for the protection of women and children’s rights, for the promotion of gender equality, on domestic violence prevention and control, and on prevention of trafficking in persons. This is the starting point.\n\nWithin the National Strategy on Gender Equality Viet Nam, the police form a critical pillar in the fight against discrimination and all forms of violence. With a leading role to investigate, police are also mandated to actively prevent such occurrences through community engagement and education.\n\nI therefore welcome the engagement of the Ministry of Public Security in co-organizing this year’s event. MPS is a key player in ensuring the protection and fulfilment of women and children’s rights.\n\nThere is an urgent need to bolster our systems to be more supportive of victims of violence to seek help. Since 2019, the National Survey on Violence Against Women revealed that many women prefer to remain silent or keep it within the family. Less than 5% (or only 4.8 percent) of women surveyed turned to the police for assistance. This is where we need to come together.\n\nThe United Nations is contributing to build capacity of the Vietnamese police in handling cases with sensitivity. For example, in ensuring that police investigations are child-friendly, victim-friendly, gender-sensitive as well as gender responsive. Concretely, 53 child-friendly investigation rooms have been introduced, with a target to cover all 63 provinces by the end of the year. Rapid taskforce teams have also been established to respond to domestic violence at local level. Together, we have ensured that the police are fully equipped and trained to instil confidence and safety in women and children in reporting cases; and in seeking help from the authorities.\n\nWhile we celebrate our progress, together with partners, the United Nations commits to do better in 4 areas:\n\nOne, establishing a dedicated specialised police unit, with adequately trained female and male staff to handle cases of violence against women and children.\n\nTwo, expanding training to all police officers, at both in-service and pre-service levels.\n\nThree, enhancing coordination for better access to critical services in health care and legal aid, as well as to social workers and community organizations.\n\nFour, improving public awareness about gender-based violence and creating channels for reporting incidents safely and anonymously.\n\nOur commemoration of the 16 Days of Activism against Gender-Based Violence and the National Action Month is fully aligned with global advocacy centred on moving: \"Towards 30 Years of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action: UNITE to End Violence Against Women.\"\n\nI take this opportunity to commend the Ministry of Labour, Invalids, and Social Affairs (MOLISA) for its leadership in the national review of the implementation of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action. The Beijing Declaration remains the most comprehensive political commitment to women’s rights. Viet Nam’s national report shows us progress made in advancing gender equality. It also shares Viet Nam’s lessons in translating its legal and policy commitments into tangible results.\n\nThe United Nations reaffirms support to the government in addressing the challenges also outlined in its report. We take note of the need to:\n\nIn 2025, we celebrate the 30-year milestone of implementing the Beijing Declaration. Let us amplify the message that there is #NoExcuse for violence against women and girls. Together, we can create a safer and more equitable society for all.\n\nXin cam on!"}]}

We are happy to see many students today. Women and men, and people of diverse gender identities. I am sure the interaction today will give you a lot of food for thought for your own lives and careers.\n\nConviction, Commitment and Courage… The 3Cs of leadership according to Ms. Bachelet. A good starting point for our discussion today. In her video, she also discusses about the different ways women lead, which might be different, but by no means less effective.\n\nThis bring us to the important role that women can and are due to play in decision-making processes, which unfortunately,remains insufficient and low;limiting theirability to contribute fully to society.\n\nIn Viet Nam, althoughwomen’s representation in the National Assembly has been positively recognized for being higher than the global average (at 30.26%, 5% higher than the 26.5%). Still, womenparliamentarianstend to be clustered in certain committees, such usethnic and social affairs, but their representation in committees addressingfinancial, budgetary, security and defence issues is low.There is still apersistent ideathatwomen’s leadership is more suitableto address certain questions, often call“soft issues” but not “the hard ones”.\n\nIn other areas of government women’s representation remains low. Currently,in Viet Nam only, 3 out of 27 ministersare women, and onlyone of the 18 members of the Politburo is woman. Moreover, women represent only the6% of the formal decision-making bodies on national defence.\n\nThe lack of participation of women in decision-making positions is not only limiting to the women themselves, but to society at large. Basically, we are missing half of the population’s ideas and talents.\n\nWhen the UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterrescame to Viet Nam last year, heno longer spoke about acceleratingthe Sustainable Development Goals.He spoke about rescuing them!!!Advancing gender equality and the empowerment of women is at the fore front of these rescue efforts, not only for SDG5 but for allof the 17 Sustainable Development Goals.\n\nBy promoting women’s empowerment and equal participation in decision making,we can generate the best solutions to increasingly complex challenges of society.\n\nDistinguished guests and students,\n\nToday, we have the have aunique and rare opportunity to have a face-to-face dialoguewithone of our most successful and influential women leadersof our times:\n\nIn this sessionwe have the opportunity to engage in aninformal dialogue with Ms Bachelet, todiscuss and reflect about her leadership journey, as a way to inspire so many Vietnamese women present here today, that will bethe next generation of leaders and diplomats. But also, to hear from her and exchange ideas aboutthe role women in the world. Men are also invited to this discussion, as gender equality is a matter for all.\n\nI stop here. Without a further a due, I’ll pass the microphone to Ms. Dung, so that she can give the floor to Ms Bachelet.\n\nThank you. Xin cảm ơn!"}]}

Since 2015, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and UNDP in Viet Nam, in its broader role as Chair of the One UN Results Group on Governance and Justice, have established a ‘tradition’ of collaborating to commemorate International Human Rights Day. This year’s global theme for Human Rights Day aligns with today’s programme, reflecting on the challenges and opportunities presented by the COVID-19 pandemic. Both the UN Secretary General and the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights have called on all countries to build forward better by standing up for human rights. Implementation of all of the 3rd Cycle Universal Periodic Review (UPR) recommendations made, not just those accepted by Viet Nam, will ensure that Viet Nam achieves that goal.\n\nThis year has been a difficult one for everyone, and the world continues to grapple with COVID-19. Viet Nam has done exceptionally well in addressing and containing its health-related aspects through early, effective and robust measures, and we are among the lucky ones to be able to physically gather together on occasions such as today. However, many challenges still remain for Viet Nam. The September 2020 UN Assessment of the Social and Economic Impact of COVID-19 in Viet Nam, which I understand the UNDP Resident Representative will present in more detail today, highlighted the complex and grave socio-economic impacts of the pandemic. Importantly, the assessment highlighted that the protection of human rights across the spectrum, including economic, social, cultural, civil and political rights, must be at the heart of any measures and policy interventions aimed at addressing the impacts of COVID-19. The UN Secretary-General has also underlined that responses that are shaped by and respect human rights “prepare the ground for emerging from this crisis with more equitable and sustainable societies, development and peace.”\n\nAs noted in the UN Viet Nam joint statement for Human Rights Day last week, the COVID-19 pandemic has deepened pre-existing inequalities, exposing deep-rooted vulnerabilities in social, political and economic systems. Many of these challenges to Viet Nam’s achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) had previously been raised in different fora, by UN human rights experts and Treaty Bodies, as well as by fellow States during the Universal Periodic Review (UPR). Detailed recommendations across every area of human rights and the SDGs – covering all aspects of life impacted by COVID-19 – have also been made this year to support Viet Nam in tackling root causes, ensuring full protection of human rights and achieving the 2030 Agenda. I hope that these recommendations will form the foundation of Viet Nam’s response and recovery to COVID-19 and any future such complex emergencies.\n\nDistinguished guests,\n\nIn this testing time, we should redouble our collective efforts to leave no one behind. In this regard, allow me to make three specific points about the response and recovery measures.First, such measures must take into account the disproportionate impacts of the pandemic on the marginalized and the most vulnerable. Incorporating the perspectives, voices and knowledge of the people most affected in response and recovery measures will also be essential. By ensuring their representation, participation and leadership roles, Viet Nam will guarantee that no one is left behind.\n\nSecond, the response and recovery measures should also prioritize fundamental freedoms, particularly freedom of expression online and offline, the right to access information, and the right to participate in decision-making that affects one’s life. These rights should allow meaningful participation of all sectors of society and diverse non-government actors, including human rights defenders, in the design and implementation of government responses to COVID-19. As emphasised by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mme. Michelle Bachelet, the contribution of such actors “to surviving the pandemic and recovering better once it is over, will be absolutely vital,” and the curtailing of their contributions “is one of the surest ways of undermining that recovery, by removing one of the key remedies.” A recent survey by UNDP and the Mekong Development Research Institute reveals high consensus of respondents on, and strong support for, government policy and actions to contain the pandemic. More than 90 percent of the respondents rated the responses from the National Steering Committee on COVID-19 Prevention and Control and provincial governments as good or very good. Building on this success in generating public trust in its COVID-19 health response, the Government should foster whole-of-society participation to build forward better on a much broader range of human rights and other related issues.\n\nThird, while the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights acknowledges that human rights can be limited during times of emergencies, such as pandemics and natural disasters, there are clear principles that define such limitations. Any measures that restrict human rights, such as health surveillance tools and efforts to counteract misinformation, if absolutely necessary, should be proportionate to the evaluated risk, serve a legitimate public health objective and be applied in a non-discriminatory manner. This means having a specific focus, duration and end-date, and taking the least intrusive approach possible to protect public health.\n\nDistinguished guests,\n\nNow is the time for Viet Nam to put even greater energy into enhancing the full protection and enjoyment of human rights by all its citizens, as well as strengthening its compliance with its international obligations and commitments. Four opportunities present themselves in 2021:First, Viet Nam will report on its implementation of recommendations made by the UN Human Rights Committee in 2019;Second, it will engage in the voluntary mid-term reporting of the UPR process;Third, it will adopt and implement both its next Social and Economic Development Strategy and Plan; andlast but certainly not least, Viet Nam will work with the UN in Viet Nam to develop the next UN Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework for 2022 - 2026. Viet Nam, in collaboration with the UN, must seize these opportunities to build on the country’s progress over the more than 40 years since it joined the United Nations in September 1977 – prioritising frank and reflective engagement through constructive dialogues; by embedding human rights at the core of these processes; guaranteeing meaningful participation of those most affected and most at risk of being left behind, including through a national public consultation to inform the UPR mid-term report; and avoiding, in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, the risk of reversing the impressive development advances which Viet Nam has already made.\n\nFrom individuals to the Government, from non-governmental organizations and grass-roots communities to the private sector, everyone has a role in building a post-COVID Viet Nam that is better for both present and future generations. The UN in Viet Nam will continue to work closely with the Government and people of Viet Nam to support them in achieving this worthy aspiration.\n\nI thank you for listening. Xin Cam On."}]}
